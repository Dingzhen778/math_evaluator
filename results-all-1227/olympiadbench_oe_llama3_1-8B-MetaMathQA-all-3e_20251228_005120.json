This means that we cannot place a domino in the same row or column as the previous domino.\nTo maximize the number of dominoes, we want to place as many dominoes as possible in each row and column.\nSince we cannot place a domino in the same row or column as the previous domino, we can only place a domino in every other row and every other column.\nTherefore, the maximum number of dominoes that can be placed on the board is $\\frac{(m-1)(2n-2)}{2}$.\nFinally, we need to consider the condition that the bottom row is completely covered by $n$ dominoes.\nSince the bottom row is already covered, we subtract $n$ from the maximum number of dominoes to get the final answer:\n$\\frac{(m-1)(2n-2)}{2} - n = \\frac{(m-1)(2n-2) - 2n}{2} = \\frac{(m-1)(2n-2-2)}{2} = \\frac{(m-1)(2n-4)}{2} = \\frac{(m-1)(2n-2)(n-2)}{2}$.\nTherefore, the largest number of dominoes that can be placed on the board is $\\boxed{\\frac{(m-1)(2n-2)(n-2)}{2}}$.The answer is: \\frac{(m-1)(2n-2)(n-2)}{2}",

Since $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, the only possible values for $a^2 + b^2$ are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96, 100, 104, 108, 112, 116, 120, 124, 128, 132, 136, 140, 144, 148, 152, 156, 160, 164, 168, 172, 176, 180, 184, 188, 192, 196, 200, 204, 208, 212, 216, 220, 224, 228, 232, 236, 240, 244, 248, 252, 256, 260, 264, 268, 272, 276, 280, 284, 288, 292, 296, 300, 304, 308, 312, 316, 320, 324, 328, 332, 336, 340, 344, 348, 352, 356, 360, 364, 368, 372, 376, 380, 384, 388, 392, 396, 400, 404, 408, 412, 416, 420, 424, 428, 432, 436, 440, 444, 448, 452, 456, 460, 464, 468, 472, 476, 480, 484, 488, 492, 496, 500, 504, 508, 512, 516, 520, 524, 528, 532, 536, 540, 544, 548, 552, 556, 560, 564, 568, 572, 576, 580, 584, 588, 592, 596, 600, 604, 608, 612, 616, 620, 624, 628, 632, 636, 640, 644, 648, 652, 656, 660, 664, 668, 672, 676, 680, 684, 688, 692, 696, 700, 704, 708, 712, 716, 720, 724, 728, 732, 736, 740, 744, 748, 752, 756, 760, 764, 768, 772, 776, 780, 784, 788, 792, 796, 800, 804, 808, 812, 816, 820, 824, 828, 832, 836, 840, 844, 848, 852, 856, 860, 864, 868, 872, 876, 880, 884, 888, 892, 896, 900, 904, 908, 912, 916, 920, 924, 928, 932, 936, 940, 944, 948, 952, 956, 960, 964, 968, 972, 976, 980, 984, 988, 992, 996, 1000, 1004, 1008, 1012, 1016, 1020, 1024, 1028, 1032, 1036, 1040, 1044, 1048, 1052, 1056, 1060, 1064, 1068, 1072, 1076, 1080, 1084, 1088, 1092, 1096, 1100, 1104, 1108, 1112, 1116, 1120, 1124, 1128, 1132, 1136, 1140, 1144, 1148, 1152, 1156, 1160, 1164, 1168, 1172, 1176, 1180, 1184, 1188, 1192, 1196, 1200, 1204, 1208, 1212, 1216, 1220, 1224, 1228, 1232, 1236, 1240, 1244, 1248, 1252, 1256, 1260, 1264, 1268, 1272, 1276, 1280, 1284, 1288, 1292, 1296, 1300, 1304, 1308, 1312, 1316, 1320, 1324, 1328, 1332, 1336, 1340, 1344, 1348, 1352, 1356, 1360, 1364, 1368, 1372, 1376, 1380, 1384, 1388, 1392, 1396, 1400, 1404, 1408, 1412, 1416, 1420, 1424, 1428, 1432, 1436, 1440, 1444, 1448, 1452, 1456, 1460, 1464, 1468, 1472, 1476, 1480, 1484, 1488, 1492, 1496, 1500, 1504, 1508, 1512, 1516, 1520, 1524, 1528, 1532, 1536, 1540, 1544, 1548, 1552, 1556, 1560, 1564, 1568, 1572, 1576, 1580, 1584, 1588, 1592, 1596, 1600, 1604, 1608, 1612, 1616, 1620, 1624, 1628, 1632, 1636, 1640, 1644, 1648, 1652, 1656, 1660, 1664, 1668, 1672, 1676, 1680, 1684, 1688, 1692, 1696, 1700, 1704, 1708, 1712, 1716, 1720, 1724, 1728, 1732, 1736, 1740, 1744, 1748, 1752, 1756, 1760, 1764, 1768, 1772, 1776, 1780, 1784, 1788, 1792, 1796, 1800, 1804, 1808, 1812, 1816, 1820, 1824, 1828, 1832, 1836, 1840, 1844, 1848, 1852, 1856, 1860, 1864, 1868, 1872, 1876, 1880, 1884, 1888, 1892, 1896, 1900, 1904, 1908, 1912, 1916, 1920, 1924, 1928, 1932, 1936, 1940, 1944, 194",

      "generated_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest integer $m$ such that if $\\mathcal{D}$ contains at least $m$ different strings, then Lexi can fill her grid in the given manner.\n\nLet's consider the first row of the grid. Since each column must contain a string from $\\mathcal{D}$ when read from top-to-bottom, the first row must contain all possible $k$-letter strings that can be formed using only the letters $A$ and $B$. This means that the first row must contain all possible $k$-letter strings that can be formed using only the letters $A$ and $B$.\n\nSimilarly, the second row must contain all possible $k$-letter strings that can be formed using only the letters $A$ and $B$. However, since the first row already contains all possible $k$-letter strings, the second row must contain all possible $k$-letter strings that can be formed using only the letters $A$ and $B$ but with the restriction that the first letter must be different from the first letter in the first row.\n\nContinuing this pattern, the $i$th row must contain all possible $k$-letter strings that can be formed using only the letters $A$ and $B$ but with the restriction that the first $i-1$ letters must be different from the first $i-1$ letters in the previous rows.\n\nTherefore, the number of different strings in $\\mathcal{D}$ must be at least the number of different strings in the first $k$ rows of the grid. This number is equal to the number of different strings that can be formed using only the letters $A$ and $B$ with the restriction that the first $i-1$ letters must be different from the first $i-1$ letters in the previous rows.\n\nTo find this number, we can use the concept of stars and bars. We have $k$ positions to fill with $k$ stars and $k-1$ bars. The number of different ways to arrange the stars and bars is equal to the number of different strings in the first $k$ rows of the grid.\n\nUsing stars and bars, the number of different ways to arrange the stars and bars is $\\binom{k+k-1}{k-1} = \\binom{2k-1}{k-1}$. Therefore, the number of different strings in $\\mathcal{D}$ must be at least $\\binom{2k-1}{k-1}$.\n\nTo find the smallest integer $m$, we need to find the smallest $k$ such that $\\binom{2k-1}{k-1} \\geq m$. We can use the inequality $\\binom{2k-1}{k-1} \\geq \\frac{4^k}{2k}$ to find the smallest $k$.\n\nSimplifying the inequality, we have $\\binom{2k-1}{k-1} \\geq \\frac{4^k}{2k}$. Since $\\binom{2k-1}{k-1}$ is an integer, we can rewrite the inequality as $\\binom{2k-1}{k-1} \\geq \\left\\lceil \\frac{4^k}{2k} \\right\\rceil$.\n\nTo find the smallest $k$ such that $\\binom{2k-1}{k-1} \\geq \\left\\lceil \\frac{4^k}{2k} \\right\\rceil$, we can use a computer program or a calculator to find the smallest $k$ that satisfies this inequality.\n\nFor example, if we set $m = 1$, we find that $\\binom{2k-1}{k-1} \\geq 1$ is satisfied for $k \\geq 2$. If we set $m = 2$, we find that $\\binom{2k-1}{k-1} \\geq 2$ is satisfied for $k \\geq 3$. If we set $m = 3$, we find that $\\binom{2k-1}{k-1} \\geq 3$ is satisfied for $k \\geq 4$. And so on.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer $m$ such that if $\\mathcal{D}$ contains at least $m$ different strings, then Lexi can fill her grid in the given manner is $\\boxed{2}$.\n\nThe answer is: 2",

The possible values of $b$ and $c$ are the positive integers less than or equal to $n-1$.\nIf $a=2$, then $b+c=n-2$.

      "question": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\nOf the houses with positive numbers less than 100, find, with proof, the house or houses which is (are) closest to City Hall.",

However, eighteen families arrive and are looking to move in. After much debate, the connotations of using negative house numbers are deemed unacceptable, and the city decides on an alternative plan. On July 17, Shewad Movers arrive and relocate every family from house $n$ to house $n+18$, for all positive $n$ (so that City Hall does not move). For example, the family in house number 17 moves to house number 35.\nRoss takes a walk starting at his house, which is number 34 . He first visits house $n_{1}$, such that $d\\left(n_{1}, 34\\right)=1 / 3$. He then goes to another house, $n_{2}$, such that $d\\left(n_{1}, n_{2}\\right)=1 / 3$. Continuing in that way, he visits houses $n_{3}, n_{4}, \\ldots$, and each time, $d\\left(n_{i}, n_{i+1}\\right)=1 / 3$.

A signature that occurs for exactly one $n$-label is called unique, and a signature that doesn't occur for any $n$-labels is called impossible.
