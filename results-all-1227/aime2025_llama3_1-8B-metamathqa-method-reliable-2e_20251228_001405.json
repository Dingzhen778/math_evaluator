We are given that $A = 72$, so we have $\\frac{1}{2}(r+s)h = 72$. Since the radius of the inscribed circle is 3, the distance between the parallel sides is $2r$ and $2s$. Therefore, we have $2r = 2s + 6$. Solving for $s$, we find $s = r - 3$. Substituting this into the equation $\\frac{1}{2}(r+s)h = 72$, we get $\\frac{1}{2}(r+(r-3))h = 72$.

We are given that $r \\neq s$, so $r \\neq r-3$. Therefore, $r \\neq 3$. Since $r$ is an integer, we can conclude that $r > 3$. Let's try $r = 4$. Plugging in $r = 4$ into the equation $2r-3h = 144$, we get $8-3h = 144$. Solving for $h$, we find $h = 40$.

He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm.
