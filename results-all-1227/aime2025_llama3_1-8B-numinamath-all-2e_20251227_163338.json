We need to find the number of ways to draw 12 segments of equal length such that each vertex in \\( S \\) is an endpoint of exactly one of these 12 segments.\n\n2. **Initial Observations:**\n   - Each segment connects two vertices.\n   - Since there are 24 vertices, and each vertex must be an endpoint of exactly one segment, each segment must connect two vertices that are 12 vertices apart (since \\( 24 / 2 = 12 \\)).\n\n3. **Choosing the First Segment:**\n   - We start by choosing any two vertices to form the first segment. There are \\( \\binom{24}{2} \\) ways to choose the first segment.\n   - After choosing the first segment, we are left with 22 vertices.\n\n4. **Choosing the Second Segment:**\n   - For the second segment, we need to choose two vertices that are 12 vertices apart from the first segment's endpoints. This can be done in 2 ways (either clockwise or counterclockwise).\n   - After choosing the second segment, we are left with 20 vertices.\n\n5. **Continuing the Process:**\n   - We continue this process, reducing the number of vertices by 2 each time.\n   - For the third segment, we have 2 choices (clockwise or counterclockwise), and so on.\n\n6. **Calculating the Total Number of Ways:**\n   - The total number of ways to choose the segments is the product of the number of choices for each segment.\n   - The number of choices for the \\( k \\)-th segment is 2, and there are 12 segments.\n   - Therefore, the total number of ways is \\( 2^{12} \\).\n\n7. **Final Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of ways} = 2^{12} = 4096\n   \\]\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   The number of ways to draw 12 segments of equal length such that each vertex in \\( S \\) is an endpoint of exactly one of these segments is \\( \\boxed{4096} \\).",

This means the critical points must be consecutive integers.\n\n5. **Determine the value of \\( k \\):**\n   Since \\( 18, 72, \\) and \\( 98 \\) are consecutive integers, the fourth critical point \\( k \\) must be such that \\( 18 < k < 72 \\). The only integer value of \\( k \\) that satisfies this condition is \\( k = 61 \\).\n\n6. **Verify the function's behavior:**\n   We need to verify that the function \\( f(x) \\) has a minimum at \\( x = 18 \\) and \\( x = 72 \\) and is increasing before and after these points. The function \\( f(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree 4, and its behavior can be analyzed by its leading coefficient and the critical points.\n\n7. **Sum of the values of \\( k \\):**\n   The three values of \\( k \\) that satisfy the conditions are \\( 18, 72, \\) and \\( 98 \\). The sum of these values is:\n   \\[\n   18 + 72 + 98 = 188\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{188}\\).",
