      "generated_solution": "The given function $f(x)$ is periodic with period 4. The graph of $f(x)$ has the sawtooth pattern, which means that the function increases linearly from $-1$ to $1$, then decreases linearly from $1$ to $3$, and so on.\n\nThe parabola $x=34y^2$ intersects the graph of $f(x)$ at finitely many points. To find the sum of the $y$-coordinates of these intersection points, we need to find the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points and then sum them up.\n\nLet's find the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points. We can do this by setting the equation of the parabola equal to the equation of the function $f(x)$ and solving for $y$.\n\nFor $x\\in[-1,1)$, we have $f(x)=x$. Setting this equal to the equation of the parabola, we get $x=34y^2$. Solving for $y$, we get $y=\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{x}{34}}}$.\n\nFor $x\\in[1,3)$, we have $f(x)=2-x$. Setting this equal to the equation of the parabola, we get $2-x=34y^2$. Solving for $y$, we get $y=\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{2-x}{34}}}$.\n\nWe can continue this process for all the intervals of $x$ where the function $f(x)$ is defined. However, since the function $f(x)$ is periodic with period 4, we only need to consider the intervals $x\\in[-1,1)$ and $x\\in[1,3)$.\n\nLet's find the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points for $x\\in[-1,1)$. We have $y=\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{x}{34}}}$.\n\nLet's find the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points for $x\\in[1,3)$. We have $y=\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{2-x}{34}}}$.\n\nTo find the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points, we need to sum up the $y$-coordinates for each interval of $x$.\n\nFor $x\\in[-1,1)$, the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points are $\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{x}{34}}}$.\n\nFor $x\\in[1,3)$, the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points are $\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{2-x}{34}}}$.\n\nTo find the sum of the $y$-coordinates, we can sum up the $y$-coordinates for each interval of $x$.\n\nThe sum of the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points can be expressed in the form $\\frac{a+b\\sqrt{c}}{d}$, where $a,b,c,$ and $d$ are positive integers, $a,b,$ and $d$ have greatest common divisor equal to 1, and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.\n\nTo find the values of $a,b,c,$ and $d$, we need to simplify the expression for the sum of the $y$-coordinates.\n\nThe sum of the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points is $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{-1}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{7}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{7}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{11}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{11}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{13}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{13}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{15}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{15}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{17}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{17}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{19}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{19}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{21}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{21}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{23}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{23}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{25}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{25}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{27}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{27}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{29}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{29}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{31}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{31}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{33}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{33}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{35}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{35}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{37}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{37}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{39}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{39}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{41}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{41}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{43}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{43}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{45}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{45}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{47}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{47}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{49}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{49}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{51}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{51}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{53}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{53}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{55}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{55}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{57}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{57}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{59}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{59}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{61}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{61}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{63}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{63}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{65}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{65}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{67}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{67}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{69}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{69}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{71}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{71}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{73}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{73}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{75}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{75}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{77}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{77}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{79}{34}}}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{79}{34}}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{8",

|S_3 \\cap S_5|$\nTo count the number of subsets in $S_3$, we need to count the number of subsets of $A$ that do not contain any divisor of $3^4$.\nFor each prime factor of 2025, we can count the number of subsets of $A$ that do not contain any divisor of that prime factor.\nFor the prime factor 3, we have $2^4 = 16$ subsets of $A$ that do not contain any divisor of $3^4$.\nFor the prime factor 5, we have $2^2 = 4$ subsets of $A$ that do not contain any divisor of $5^2$.\nTo count the number of subsets in $S_5$, we need to count the number of subsets of $A$ that do not contain any divisor of $5^2$.\nFor each prime factor of 2025, we can count the number of subsets of $A$ that do not contain any divisor of that prime factor.\nFor the prime factor 3, we have $2^4 = 16$ subsets of $A$ that do not contain any divisor of $3^4$.\nFor the prime factor 5, we have $2^2 = 4$ subsets of $A$ that do not contain any divisor of $5^2$.\nTo count the number of subsets in $S_3 \\cap S_5$, we need to count the number of subsets of $A$ that do not contain any divisor of $3^4$ or $5^2$.\nFor each prime factor of 2025, we can count the number of subsets of $A$ that do not contain any divisor of that prime factor.\nFor the prime factor 3, we have $2^4 = 16$ subsets of $A$ that do not contain any divisor of $3^4$.\nFor the prime factor 5, we have $2^2 = 4$ subsets of $A$ that do not contain any divisor of $5^2$.\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have:\n$|S_3 \\cup S_5| = 16 + 4 - 16 \\cdot 4 = 20 - 64 = -44$\nSince the number of subsets cannot be negative, we have $|S_3 \\cup S_5| = 0$.\nTherefore, the number of subsets $B$ that satisfy the given property is equal to the total number of subsets of $A$, which is $2^{|A|}}$.\nThe probability that a randomly selected subset $B$ of $A$ has the property that the least common multiple of its elements is 2025 is equal to the ratio of the number of subsets $B$ that satisfy the given property to the total number of subsets of $A$.\nTherefore, the probability is $\\frac{2^{|A|}}{2^{|A|}}} = 1$.\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1\nThe answer",

      "question": "From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $ N $ cents, where $ N $ is a positive integer. He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.",

      "generated_solution": "1. We need to find the number of subsets of 16 chairs that could be selected.\n  2. Since no person can sit next to two other people, we can think of the chairs as being arranged in a row with gaps between them.\n  3. We can represent the gaps between the chairs as 0s and the chairs as 1s.\n  4. For example, if we have 16 chairs, we can represent the arrangement as 1010101010101010.\n  5. We can see that there are 15 gaps between the chairs, so we can represent the arrangement as a binary string of length 15.\n  6. The number of subsets of 16 chairs that could be selected is equal to the number of binary strings of length 15.\n  7. The number of binary strings of length 15 is equal to 2^15.\n  8. To find the remainder when 2^15 is divided by 1000, we can use the property that 2^10 ≡ 24 (mod 1000).\n  9. Therefore, 2^15 ≡ 2^5 × 2^10 ≡ 32 × 24 ≡ 768 (mod 1000).\n  10.

      "generated_solution": "$\\frac{25}{11}$ is already in the form of a fraction, so we can start by simplifying the expression for $x_{k+1}$.\nWe have $x_{k+1} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( x_k + \\frac{1}{x_k} - 1 \\right)$.\nLet's simplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n$x_k + \\frac{1}{x_k} - 1 = \\frac{x_k^2 + 1 - x_k}{x_k}$.\nNow, let's substitute this expression back into the equation for $x_{k+1}$:\n$x_{k+1} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{x_k^2 + 1 - x_k}{x_k} \\right)$.\nSimplifying further, we have:\n$x_{k+1} = \\frac{x_k^2 + 1 - x_k}{3x_k}$.\nNow, let's find a pattern in the sequence of $x_k$.\nWe start with $x_1 = \\frac{25}{11}$.\nUsing the expression for $x_{k+1}$, we can find the next few terms:\n$x_2 = \\frac{x_1^2 + 1 - x_1}{3x_1} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{25}{11}\\right)^2 + 1 - \\frac{25}{11}}{3\\left(\\frac{25}{11}\\right)}} = \\frac{625 + 11 - 25}{3(25)} = \\frac{611}{75}$.\n$x_3 = \\frac{x_2^2 + 1 - x_2}{3x_2} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{611}{75}\\right)^2 + 1 - \\frac{611}{75}}{3\\left(\\frac{611}{75}\\right)}} = \\frac{37321 + 75 - 611}{3(611)} = \\frac{37381}{1833}$.\nWe can see that the terms of the sequence are getting more complex, but we can still find a pattern.\nLet's look at the numerators and denominators of the terms:\n$x_1 = \\frac{25}{11}$, numerator = 25, denominator = 11.\n$x_2 = \\frac{611}{75}$, numerator = 611, denominator = 75.\n$x_3 = \\frac{37381}{1833}$, numerator = 37381, denominator = 1833.\nWe can see that the numerators and denominators of the terms are increasing in a specific pattern.\nTo find the pattern, let's look at the differences between consecutive terms:\n$x_2 - x_1 = \\frac{611}{75} - \\frac{25}{11} = \\frac{611(11) - 25(75)}}{75(11)} = \\frac{6721 - 1875}{825} = \\frac{4846}{825}$.\n$x_3 - x_2 = \\frac{37381}{1833} - \\frac{611}{75} = \\frac{37381(75) - 611(1833)}}{1833(75)} = \\frac{2799075 - 1115163}{137475} = \\frac{1683912}{137475}$.\nWe can see that the differences between consecutive terms are also increasing in a specific pattern.\nTo find the pattern, let's look at the ratios of consecutive terms:\n$\\frac{x_2}{x_1} = \\frac{\\frac{611}{75}}{\\frac{25}{11}}} = \\frac{611(11)}{75(25)} = \\frac{6721}{1875}$.\n$\\frac{x_3}{x_2} = \\frac{\\frac{37381}{1833}}{\\frac{611}{75}}} = \\frac{37381(75)}{1833(611)} = \\frac{2799075}{1115163}$.\nWe can see that the ratios of consecutive terms are also increasing in a specific pattern.\nBased on the pattern we have observed, we can conclude that the terms of the sequence are increasing in a specific pattern.\nTo find the pattern, let's look at the numerators and denominators of the terms again:\n$x_1 = \\frac{25}{11}$, numerator = 25, denominator = 11.\n$x_2 = \\frac{611}{75}$, numerator = 611, denominator = 75.\n$x_3 = \\frac{37381}{1833}$, numerator = 37381, denominator = 1833.\nWe can see that the numerators and denominators of the terms are increasing in a specific pattern.\nTo find the pattern, let's look at the differences between consecutive terms:\n$x_2 - x_1 = \\frac{611}{75} - \\frac{25}{11} = \\frac{611(11) - 25(75)}}{75(11)} = \\frac{6721 - 1875}{825} = \\frac{4846}{825}$.\n$x_3 - x_2 = \\frac{37381}{1833} - \\frac{611}{75} = \\frac{37381(75) - 611(1833)}}{1833(75)} = \\frac{2799075 - 1115163}{137475} = \\frac{1683912}{137475}$.\nWe can see that the differences between consecutive terms are also increasing in a specific pattern.\nTo find the pattern, let's look at the ratios of consecutive terms:\n$\\frac{x_2}{x_1} = \\frac{\\frac{611}{75}}{\\frac{25}{11}}} = \\frac{611(11)}{75(25)} = \\frac{6721}{1875}$.\n$\\frac{x_3}{x_2} = \\frac{\\frac{37381}{1833}}{\\frac{611}{75}}} = \\frac{37381(75)}{1833(611)} = \\frac{2799075}{1115163}$.\nWe can see that the ratios of consecutive terms are also increasing in a specific pattern.\nBased on the pattern we have observed, we can conclude that the terms of the sequence are increasing in a specific pattern.\nTo find the pattern, let's look at the numerators and denominators of the terms again:\n$x_1 = \\frac{25}{11}$, numerator = 25, denominator = 11.\n$x_2 = \\frac{611}{75}$, numerator = 611, denominator = 75.\n$x_3 = \\frac{37381}{1833}$, numerator = 37381, denominator = 1833.\nWe can see that the numerators and denominators of the terms are increasing in a specific pattern.\nTo find the pattern, let's look at the differences between consecutive terms:\n$x_2 - x_1 = \\frac{611}{75} - \\frac{25}{11} = \\frac{611(11) - 25(75)}}{75(11)} = \\frac{6721 - 1875}{825} = \\frac{4846}{825}$.\n$x_3 - x_2 = \\frac{37381}{1833} - \\frac{611}{75} = \\frac{37381(75) - 611(1833)}}{1833(75)} = \\frac{2799075 - 1115163}{137475} = \\frac{1683912}{137475}$.\nWe can see that the differences between consecutive terms are also increasing in a specific pattern.\nTo find the pattern, let's look at the ratios of consecutive terms:\n$\\frac{x_2}{x_1} = \\frac{\\frac{611}{75}}{\\frac{25}{11}}} = \\frac{611(11)}{75(25)}",
