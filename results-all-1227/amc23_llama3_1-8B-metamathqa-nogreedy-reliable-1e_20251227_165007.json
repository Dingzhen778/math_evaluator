Since Alicia bikes at 18 miles per hour and Beth bikes at 12 miles per hour, they will meet at a distance of $18x$ for Alicia and $12x$ for Beth.\nSince they are 45 miles apart, we have the equation $18x + 12x = 45$.\nCombining like terms, we get $30x = 45$.\nDividing both sides by 30, we find $x = \\frac{45}{30} = \\frac{3}{2}$.\nSince $x$ represents the number of hours, it must be an integer.
