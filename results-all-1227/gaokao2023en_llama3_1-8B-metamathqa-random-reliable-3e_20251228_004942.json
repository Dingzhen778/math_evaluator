      "generated_solution": "The volume of a frustum of a pyramid is given by the formula V = (1/3)Bh, where B is the area of the base and h is the height of the frustum.\n\nThe base of the frustum is a square with side length 4, so the area of the base is 4^2 = 16.\n\nThe height of the frustum is the difference in height between the original pyramid and the smaller pyramid that was cut off. The height of the original pyramid is the sum of the height of the frustum and the height of the smaller pyramid, which is 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nTherefore, the volume of the frustum is (1/3)(16)(6) = 32.\n\nThe answer is: 32",

The area of a trapezoid is given by A = (1/2)(b1 + b2)h, where b1 and b2 are the lengths of the bases and h is the height. In this case, b1 = AB = 14.9 cm, b2 = DC = 9.6 cm, and h = AD = 12.8 cm.
