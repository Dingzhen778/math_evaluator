At least one player chose each flavor, and the number of players who chose chocolate was greater than the number of players who chose vanilla, which was greater than the number of players who chose strawberry. Let $N$ be the number of different assignments of flavors to players that meet these conditions. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by 1000.",

      "generated_solution": "1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have 9 players, each choosing from 3 flavors: chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry.\n   - Each flavor must be chosen by at least one player.\n   - The number of players choosing chocolate is greater than the number choosing vanilla, which is greater than the number choosing strawberry.\n\n2. **Counting the Total Number of Assignments:**\n   - The total number of ways to assign 9 players to 3 flavors is given by the multinomial coefficient:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{9}{3, 3, 3} = \\frac{9!}{3! \\cdot 3! \\cdot 3!}\n     \\]\n   - Calculating this, we get:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{9}{3, 3, 3} = \\frac{9!}{3! \\cdot 3! \\cdot 3!} = \\frac{362880}{6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6} = 1680\n     \\]\n\n3. **Counting the Invalid Assignments:**\n   - We need to subtract the number of assignments that do not meet the given conditions.\n   - **Case 1: All players choose the same flavor.**\n     - There are 3 ways to choose the flavor (chocolate, vanilla, strawberry).\n     - Each way has only 1 valid assignment (all players choose the same flavor).\n     - Thus, there are 3 invalid assignments.\n   - **Case 2: Two flavors have 4 players each, and the third flavor has 1 player.**\n     - There are 3 ways to choose the flavor with 1 player (chocolate, vanilla, strawberry).\n     - For each choice, there are 3 ways to choose which flavor has 4 players (the other two flavors must have 4 and 1 players respectively).\n     - Thus, there are \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) invalid assignments.\n   - **Case 3: Two flavors have 5 players each, and the third flavor has 3 players.**\n     - There are 3 ways to choose the flavor with 3 players (chocolate, vanilla, strawberry).\n     - For each choice, there are 3 ways to choose which flavor has 5 players (the other two flavors must have 5 and 3 players respectively).\n     - Thus, there are \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) invalid assignments.\n\n4. **Calculating the Valid Assignments:**\n   - Subtract the invalid assignments from the total number of assignments:\n     \\[\n     1680 - 3 - 9 - 9 = 1680 - 21 = 1659\n     \\]\n\n5. **Finding the Remainder When Divided by 1000:**\n   - We need to find the remainder when 1659 is divided by 1000:\n     \\[\n     1659 \\div 1000 = 1 \\text{ remainder } 659\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the remainder is 659.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{659}\\).",

      "generated_solution": "To solve the problem, we need to find the number of eight-digit integers that are divisible by 22 using the digits $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8$ exactly once. We will use the concept of modular arithmetic and the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve this problem.\n\n1. **Divisibility by 2**: \n   - For a number to be divisible by 2, its last digit must be even. The even digits available are $2, 4, 6, 8$. Therefore, there are 4 choices for the last digit.\n\n2. **Divisibility by 11**:\n   - For a number to be divisible by 11, the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions must be a multiple of 11. Let's denote the digits in odd positions as $a_1, a_3, a_5, a_7$ and the digits in even positions as $a_2, a_4, a_6, a_8$.\n   - The sum of the digits in odd positions is $a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7$.\n   - The sum of the digits in even positions is $a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8$.\n   - The difference between these sums is $(a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7) - (a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8)$.\n   - For this difference to be a multiple of 11, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the digits such that the difference is a multiple of 11.\n\n3. **Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem**:\n   - We need to find the number of solutions to the congruence $a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7 - (a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n   - Since the sum of the digits $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36$, we can rewrite the congruence as $a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7 - (a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8) \\equiv 36 - (a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8) \\pmod{11}$.\n   - We need to find the number of ways to distribute the digits such that the sum of the even-position digits is $36 - (a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7)$, which is a multiple of 11.\n\n4. **Counting the valid combinations**:\n   - We need to count the number of ways to distribute the digits such that the sum of the even-position digits is a multiple of 11. This can be done by considering the possible values of $a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7$ and finding the corresponding values of $a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8$ that are multiples of 11.\n   - By trial and error or systematic counting, we find that there are 4 valid combinations.\n\n5. **Calculating the total number of such numbers**:\n   - There are 4 choices for the last digit (even digits).\n   - There are 4 valid combinations for the sum of the digits in odd and even positions.\n   - The total number of such numbers is $4 \\times 4 = 16$.\n\n6. **Finding the difference**:\n   - The total number of eight-digit integers using each digit exactly once is $8! = 40320$.\n   - The number of such integers divisible by 22 is 16.\n   - The difference between $N$ and 2025 is $40320 - 16 = 40204$.\n\nTherefore, the difference between $N$ and 2025 is $\\boxed{40204}$.",

However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.",

This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to select 8 chairs from 16, ensuring that no two selected chairs are adjacent.\n\n2. **Using Combinatorial Counting:**\n   The number of ways to select 8 chairs from 16 is given by the binomial coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{16}{8}\n   \\]\n   This represents the total number of ways to choose 8 chairs out of 16 without any restrictions.\n\n3. **Adjusting for Adjacency:**\n   To ensure no two selected chairs are adjacent, we can use the method of \"stars and bars.\" This involves placing dividers (bars) between the stars (chairs) to create groups of non-adjacent chairs. The number of ways to arrange 8 stars and 7 bars (to separate the stars into 8 groups) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{15}{7}\n   \\]\n   This is because we need to choose 7 positions out of 15 (16 chairs - 1 space between them) to place the bars.\n\n4. **Calculating the Number of Valid Subsets:**\n   The number of valid subsets is the ratio of the number of ways to arrange the stars and bars to the total number of ways to choose 8 chairs:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\binom{15}{7}}{\\binom{16}{8}}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplifying the Expression:**\n   Using the properties of binomial coefficients, we know:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{15}{7} = \\binom{15}{8}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\binom{15}{7}}{\\binom{16}{8}} = \\frac{\\binom{15}{8}}{\\binom{16}{8}}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculating the Final Answer:**\n   Using the property of binomial coefficients:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{16}{8} = \\binom{16}{8} = \\frac{16!}{8! \\cdot 8!}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\binom{15}{8} = \\binom{15}{7} = \\frac{15!}{7! \\cdot 8!}\n   \\]\n   The ratio simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\frac{15!}{7! \\cdot 8!}}{\\frac{16!}{8! \\cdot 8!}} = \\frac{15!}{7! \\cdot 8!} \\cdot \\frac{8! \\cdot 8!}{16!} = \\frac{15!}{7! \\cdot 16!}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying further:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{15!}{7! \\cdot 16!} = \\frac{1}{7 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 12 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 14 \\cdot 15} = \\frac{1}{360360}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Finding the Remainder When Divided by 1000:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{360360} \\div 1000 = \\frac{1}{360360000}\n   \\]\n   The remainder when divided by 1000 is:\n   \\[\n   360360000 \\mod 1000 = 360\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{360}\\).",

      "generated_solution": "To solve the problem, we need to find the values of $k$ such that the function $f(x) = \\frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k)}{x}$ achieves its minimum value at exactly two positive real numbers $x$. This implies that the denominator $x$ must be a factor of the numerator, and the roots of the numerator must be such that the function has a minimum at exactly two points.\n\n1. **Identify the roots of the numerator:**\n   The roots of the numerator are $x = 18, 72, 98, k$. These roots are distinct and positive.\n\n2. **Determine the conditions for the minimum:**\n   For the function to have a minimum at exactly two points, the roots must be such that the function is decreasing between the roots and increasing outside the roots. This means the roots must be in the order $18 < k < 72 < 98$.\n\n3. **Analyze the behavior of the function:**\n   The function $f(x)$ is a rational function with a pole at $x = 0$. The behavior of the function around the roots can be analyzed by considering the sign of the numerator and the denominator.\n\n4. **Check the sign of the numerator:**\n   The sign of the numerator changes at each root. Specifically, the sign of the numerator is positive between $18$ and $72$, negative between $72$ and $98$, and positive again for $x > 98$.\n\n5. **Determine the sign of the denominator:**\n   The denominator $x$ is positive for $x > 0$. Therefore, the sign of the entire function $f(x)$ is determined by the sign of the numerator.\n\n6. **Find the values of $k$:**\n   For $f(x)$ to have a minimum at exactly two points, the numerator must change sign at $x = k$. This means $k$ must be such that the numerator changes sign from positive to negative or vice versa. Given the order of the roots, $k$ must be between $72$ and $98$.\n\n7. **Calculate the sum of the values of $k$:**\n   The values of $k$ that satisfy the conditions are $k = 72 + \\frac{1}{2}(98 - 72) = 72 + 13 = 85$ and $k = 72 + \\frac{1}{2}(98 - 72) = 72 + 13 = 85$. The sum of these values is $85 + 85 = 170$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the three values of $k$ is $\\boxed{170}$.",
