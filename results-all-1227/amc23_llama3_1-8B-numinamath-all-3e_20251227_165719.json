Here, $a = 2n+1$ and $b = 2n-1$, so:\n   \\[\n   (2n+1)^3 - (2n-1)^3 = (2n+1 - (2n-1))((2n+1)^2 + (2n+1)(2n-1) + (2n-1)^2)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the factors, we get:\n   \\[\n   2(8n^2 + 2n + 1)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Sum the simplified expressions**: We need to sum this expression for $n$ from 1 to 9.

Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of 3 vertices is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{220 \\times 6}{2} = 660\n     \\]\n     (Dividing by 2 to account for the symmetry of the icosahedron).\n\n3. **Counting Favorable Outcomes:**\n   - We need to count the number of arrangements where \\( d(Q, R) > d(R, S) \\).\n   - Consider the icosahedron's structure. The 12 vertices can be divided into 3 groups: 5 vertices on the top face, 5 vertices on the bottom face, and 2 vertices on the middle face.\n   - For \\( d(Q, R) > d(R, S) \\) to hold, \\( Q \\) and \\( R \\) must be on the same face, and \\( S \\) must be on a different face.\n   - There are 3 faces, and each face has 5 vertices. The number of ways to choose 2 vertices from the same face is:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\n     \\]\n   - The number of ways to choose 1 vertex from the other face is:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{5}{1} = 5\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes for each face is:\n     \\[\n     10 \\times 5 = 50\n     \\]\n   - Since there are 3 faces, the total number of favorable outcomes is:\n     \\[\n     50 \\times 3 = 150\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculating the Probability:**\n   - The probability that \\( d(Q, R) > d(R, S) \\) is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{150}{660} = \\frac{25}{110} = \\frac{5}{22}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the fraction, we get:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{5}{22}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The final answer is \\( \\frac{5}{22} \\), and \\( m+n = 5+22 = 27 \\).\n\nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{27} \\).",

      "generated_solution": "To solve the problem, we need to determine for how many dates in 2023 each digit appears an even number of times in the 8-digit display format (YYYYMMDD). We will analyze the distribution of each digit in the year, month, and date parts of the date.\n\n1. **Year (YYYY):**\n   - The year is 2023, which means the first digit is always 2, and the second digit is always 0. Therefore, the first and second digits are fixed.\n   - The third and fourth digits can be any of the 10 digits from 0 to 9. However, since the year is fixed as 2023, the third and fourth digits must be 2 and 3, respectively.\n   - Thus, the year contributes 0 appearances of each digit except for 2 and 3, which appear 1 time each.\n\n2. **Month (MM):**\n   - The month is a 2-digit number ranging from 01 to 12.\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 can appear in the first digit of the month, and each digit from 0 to 9 can appear in the second digit of the month.\n   - Therefore, the month contributes 2 appearances of each digit from 0 to 9.\n\n3. **Date (DD):**\n   - The date is a 2-digit number ranging from 01 to 31.\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 can appear in the first digit of the date, and each digit from 0 to 9 can appear in the second digit of the date.\n   - Therefore, the date contributes 2 appearances of each digit from 0 to 9.\n\n4. **Total Appearances:**\n   - The total number of appearances of each digit in the 8-digit display is the sum of the appearances from the year, month, and date.\n   - From the year: 0 (fixed) + 0 (fixed) + 1 (2) + 1 (3) = 2 appearances of 2 and 3.\n   - From the month: 2 appearances of each digit from 0 to 9.\n   - From the date: 2 appearances of each digit from 0 to 9.\n   - Therefore, the total appearances of each digit from 0 to 9 is 2 (from the month) + 2 (from the date) = 4 appearances.\n\n5. **Counting the Dates:**\n   - We need to count the number of dates in 2023 where each digit appears an even number of times.\n   - Since the year is fixed as 2023, the only variable parts are the month and date.\n   - The month can be any of the 12 months, and the date can be any of the 31 days in a month.\n   - Therefore, there are \\(12 \\times 31 = 372\\) possible dates in 2023.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since each digit appears an even number of times in the 8-digit display for all 372 dates in 2023, the answer is \\(\\boxed{372}\\).",

Equating the two expressions for \\( m \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{n - 10}{n - 1} = \\frac{2n - 27}{n - 3}\n   \\]\n   Cross-multiplying to clear the denominators, we get:\n   \\[\n   (n - 10)(n - 3) = (n - 1)(2n - 27)\n   \\]\n   Expanding both sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   n^2 - 13n + 30 = 2n^2 - 28n + 27\n   \\]\n   Rearranging terms, we obtain:\n   \\[\n   n^2 - 13n + 30 - 2n^2 + 28n - 27 = 0\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   -n^2 + 15n + 3 = 0\n   \\]\n   Factoring, we have:\n   \\[\n   -(n - 3)(n - 12) = 0\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \\( n = 3 \\) or \\( n = 12 \\).\n\n5. If \\( n = 3 \\), then:\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{3 - 10}{3 - 1} = \\frac{-7}{2} = -3.5\n   \\]\n   This is not possible since \\( m \\) must be an integer.\n\n6.
