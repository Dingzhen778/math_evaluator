      "generated_solution": "Let $h$ be the height of the trapezoid. The area of the trapezoid is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}(r+s)h$. We are given that $A = 72$, so we have $\\frac{1}{2}(r+s)h = 72$. Since the radius of the inscribed circle is 3, the distance between the parallel sides is $2 \\times 3 = 6$. Therefore, $h = 6$. Substituting this into the equation, we have $\\frac{1}{2}(r+s)(6) = 72$, which simplifies to $3(r+s) = 72$. Dividing both sides by 3, we get $r+s = 24$. Squaring both sides, we have $(r+s)^2 = 24^2 = 576$. Therefore, $r^2 + s^2 = 576 - 2rs$. Since $r \\neq s$, we can assume without loss of generality that $r > s$. Let $r = s + k$, where $k$ is a positive integer. Substituting this into the equation, we have $(s + k)^2 + s^2 = 576 - 2(s + k)s$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $s^2 + 2sk + k^2 + s^2 = 576 - 2s^2 - 2sk$. Combining like terms, we have $3s^2 + 2sk + k^2 = 576$. Since $s$ and $k$ are positive integers, we can try different values of $s$ and $k$ to find a solution. We find that $s = 12$ and $k = 12$ is a solution. Therefore, $r = s + k = 12 + 12 = 24$. Finally, $r^2 + s^2 = 24^2 + 12^2 = 576 + 144 = \\boxed{720}$. The answer is: 720",
