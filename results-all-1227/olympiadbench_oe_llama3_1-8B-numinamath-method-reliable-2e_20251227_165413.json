Xenia will reply with the set \\(\\{a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{20}\\}\\).\n   - Sergey can then use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to determine \\( N \\) from the set \\(\\{a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{20}\\}\\).\n\n4. **Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT):**\n   - The CRT states that if we have a system of congruences \\( x \\equiv b_i \\pmod{m_i} \\) for \\( i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n \\), where the \\( m_i \\) are pairwise coprime, then there exists a unique solution \\( x \\) modulo \\( m_1 m_2 \\cdots m_n \\).\n\n5. **Application of CRT:**\n   - In our case, the \\( m_i \\) are the 20 distinct primes less than or equal to 20, and the \\( b_i \\) are the \\( a_i \\).\n   - The product of these primes is \\( 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13 \\times 17 \\times 19 = 510510 \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Sergey can determine \\( N \\) by asking for the set \\( S = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 20\\} \\) and using the CRT to find \\( N \\) modulo 510510.\n   - Therefore, the minimum number of moves Sergey needs to determine \\( N \\) is 1.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",

Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have a rectangular board with $m$ rows and $2n$ columns.\n   - Each domino covers exactly two adjacent cells.\n   - No two dominoes overlap.\n   - No two dominoes form a $2 \\times 2$ square.\n   - The bottom row of the board is completely covered by $n$ dominoes.\n\n2. **Initial Observation:**\n   - The bottom row of the board is completely covered by $n$ dominoes, each covering two cells. Therefore, the bottom row has $2n$ cells, and each domino covers two cells, so there are $n$ dominoes in the bottom row.\n\n3. **Placing Dominoes in the Bottom Row:**\n   - Since the bottom row is completely covered by $n$ dominoes, the first $n$ columns of the board are covered by these dominoes.\n\n4. **Covering the Remaining Rows:**\n   - The remaining rows must be covered by dominoes that do not overlap and do not form a $2 \\times 2$ square.\n   - Each domino covers two cells, so the remaining rows must be covered in such a way that no two dominoes overlap and no $2 \\times 2$ squares are formed.\n\n5. **Maximizing the Number of Dominoes:**\n   - To maximize the number of dominoes, we need to cover the remaining rows efficiently.\n   - The remaining rows must be covered in a way that maximizes the number of dominoes without violating the conditions.\n\n6. **Optimal Placement:**\n   - The optimal placement is to cover the remaining rows in a checkerboard pattern, where each domino covers two adjacent cells.\n   - This pattern ensures that no two dominoes overlap and no $2 \\times 2$ squares are formed.\n\n7. **Calculating the Number of Dominoes:**\n   - The number of dominoes placed in the remaining rows is equal to the number of cells in these rows minus the number of cells covered by the dominoes in the bottom row.\n   - The number of cells in the remaining rows is $(m - 1) \\times 2n$ (since the bottom row is already covered by $n$ dominoes).\n   - The number of cells covered by the dominoes in the remaining rows is $2 \\times (m - 1)$ (since each domino covers two cells).\n\n8. **Final Calculation:**\n   - The total number of dominoes is the number of cells in the remaining rows minus the number of cells covered by the dominoes in the bottom row, which is $(m - 1) \\times 2n - 2 \\times (m - 1)$.\n   - Simplifying this expression, we get $2mn - m - n$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of dominoes that can be placed on the board is $\\boxed{2mn - m - n}$.",

These pairs sum to $15, 16, 17, \\ldots, 24$ respectively.\n   - For $n \\geq 25$, we need to consider pairs like $(4, 21), (5, 20), \\ldots, (10, 15)$.

This means that in each $2 \\times 2$ block, there will be one king in each cell.\n\n4. **Checkerboard Pattern:**\n   - The $100 \\times 100$ chessboard can be divided into $50 \\times 50$ blocks of $2 \\times 2$.\n   - Each $2 \\times 2$ block will contain exactly one king.\n\n5. **Arranging the Kings:**\n   - We need to place 2500 kings in these $50 \\times 50$ blocks.\n   - Since each block contains exactly one king, we can place the kings in any order within the blocks.\n\n6. **Permutations and Combinations:**\n   - The number of ways to arrange 2500 kings in $50 \\times 50$ blocks is the number of permutations of 2500 items, which is $2500!$.\n   - However, since the arrangement within each block is not important, we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange the kings within each block, which is $2!$ (since there are 2 kings in each block).\n\n7. **Calculating the Total Number of Arrangements:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of arrangements} = \\frac{2500!}{2^{2500}}\n   \\]\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   The number of ways to place 2500 kings on a $100 \\times 100$ chessboard such that no two kings can capture each other and each row and each column contains exactly 25 kings is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{\\frac{2500!}{2^{2500}}}\n   \\]",

This is because there are 101 rows, and each row must contain 100 distinct numbers. Therefore, there will be at least one pair of rows that share at least one number, violating the condition.\n\n3. **Constructing a Table for $N = 100$:**\n   - We can construct a table $T$ with 100 rows and 100 columns such that each row contains the numbers 1 through 100 in some order.\n   - For any two distinct rows $r$ and $s$, we can find a column $c$ such that $|T(r, c) - T(s, c)| \\geq 2$ by ensuring that the numbers in the columns are sufficiently spread out.\n\n4. **Verification for $N = 100$:**\n   - Consider any two distinct rows $r$ and $s$. Since each row contains all numbers from 1 to 100, there will be at least one number that appears in both rows. Let's denote this number as $x$.\n   - For any column $c$ where $T(r, c) = x$, we have $T(s, c) \\neq x$ because $r \\neq s$.

      "generated_solution": "1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have 2017 circles on a blackboard, each pair of which is externally tangent.\n   - Luciano draws tangent segments one at a time, ensuring no two tangent segments intersect.\n   - We need to find all possible numbers of tangent segments Luciano can draw.\n\n2. **Initial Observation:**\n   - Each circle can be tangent to at most 2 other circles at a time.\n   - Therefore, the maximum number of tangent segments that can be drawn is \\(2 \\times 2017 = 4034\\).\n\n3. **Analyzing Tangent Segments:**\n   - Each tangent segment connects two circles.\n   - If a tangent segment is drawn, it can potentially block the tangency of other circles.\n   - To ensure no two tangent segments intersect, we need to consider the arrangement of circles and tangent segments.\n\n4. **Counting Tangent Segments:**\n   - Let's consider the number of tangent segments \\( n \\).\n   - Each tangent segment connects two circles, so the number of tangent segments is equal to the number of pairs of circles.\n   - The number of ways to choose 2 circles out of 2017 is given by the combination formula \\(\\binom{2017}{2}\\).\n\n5. **Calculating the Number of Tangent Segments:**\n   - The number of ways to choose 2 circles out of 2017 is:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{2017}{2} = \\frac{2017 \\times 2016}{2} = 2017 \\times 1008\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the maximum number of tangent segments is:\n     \\[\n     2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times 1008 = 2017 \\times",

Therefore,\n\n   \\[\n   f(5) = \\frac{a_5}{a_6}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Establish the inequality:**\n\n   We need to show that for any \\( i, j, k, l \\) such that \\( i \\neq j \\neq k \\neq l \\),\n\n   \\[\n   \\left| \\frac{a_i}{a_j} - \\frac{a_k}{a_l} \\right| \\leq \\frac{a_5}{a_6}.\n   \\]\n\n   This can be rewritten as:\n\n   \\[\n   \\left| \\frac{a_i a_l - a_j a_k}{a_j a_l} \\right| \\leq \\frac{a_5}{a_6}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Analyze the numerator \\( a_i a_l - a_j a_k \\):**\n\n   Since \\( a_i, a_j, a_k, a_l \\) are all positive, we can consider the absolute value of the numerator:\n\n   \\[\n   |a_i a_l - a_j a_k| \\leq |a_i a_l| + |a_j a_k|.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Apply the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM Inequality):**\n\n   By the AM-GM inequality, for any positive numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\),\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x + y}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{xy}.\n   \\]\n\n   Applying this to \\( a_i a_l \\) and \\( a_j a_k \\), we get:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a_i a_l + a_j a_k}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{a_i a_l a_j a_k}.\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore,\n\n   \\[\n   a_i a_l + a_j a_k \\geq 2 \\sqrt{a_i a_l a_j a_k}.\n   \\]\n\n7. **Combine the results:**\n\n   Substituting back into the inequality, we have:\n\n   \\[\n   |a_i a_l - a_j a_k| \\leq a_i a_l + a_j a_k \\leq 2 \\sqrt{a_i a_l a_j a_k}.\n   \\]\n\n   Thus,\n\n   \\[\n   \\left| \\frac{a_i a_l - a_j a_k}{a_j a_l} \\right| \\leq \\frac{2 \\sqrt{a_i a_l a_j a_k}}{a_j a_l} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{a_i a_l}{a_j a_l}}.\n   \\]\n\n8. **Final step:**\n\n   Since \\( \\frac{a_i}{a_j} \\leq \\frac{a_5}{a_6} \\) and \\( \\frac{a_l}{a_j} \\leq \\frac{a_5}{a_6} \\), it follows that:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a_i a_l}{a_j a_l} \\leq \\left( \\frac{a_5}{a_6} \\right)^2.\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore,\n\n   \\[\n   2 \\sqrt{\\frac{a_i a_l}{a_j a_l}} \\leq 2 \\cdot \\frac{a_5}{a_6} = \\frac{a_5}{a_6}.\n   \\]\n\n   Hence, the smallest constant \\( C \\) that satisfies the given condition is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{\\frac{a_5}{a_6}}.\n   \\]",

Therefore, $p$ cannot divide $b!$ because $b!$ is always even for $b \\geq 2$.\n2. Consider the equation $a^p = b! + p$. Since $p$ does not divide $b!$, $p$ must divide $a^p$.

However, this is not always true for all positive integers $m$ and $n$. For example, if $m = 1$ and $n = 1$, then $m^2 + n = 2$ and $2n = 2$, which does not satisfy the divisibility condition. Therefore, our initial assumption is incorrect.\n\n2. **Contradiction Approach:**\n   Assume that $f(n) \\neq n$ for some positive integer $n$. Let $f(n) = n + k$ where $k \\geq 1$.

Substituting this into the condition, we get:\n     \\[\n     m^2 + n + 1 \\mid m(n + 1) + n\n     \\]\n     Simplifying the right-hand side, we have:\n     \\[\n     m^2 + n + 1 \\mid 2n + m\n     \\]\n     This implies that $m^2 + n + 1$ must be a divisor of $2n + m$. However, this is not always true for all positive integers $m$ and $n$. For example, if $m = 1$ and $n = 1$, then $m^2 + n + 1 = 3$ and $2n + m = 3$, which does not satisfy the divisibility condition. Therefore, $k = 1$ is not a valid solution.\n\n   - **Case 2: $k \\geq 2$**\n     If $k \\geq 2$, then $f(n) = n + k$. Substituting this into the condition, we get:\n     \\[\n     m^2 + n + k \\mid m(n + k) + n\n     \\]\n     Simplifying the right-hand side, we have:\n     \\[\n     m^2 + n + k \\mid 2n + km\n     \\]\n     This implies that $m^2 + n + k$ must be a divisor of $2n + km$. However, this is not always true for all positive integers $m$ and $n$. For example, if $m = 1$ and $n = 1$, then $m^2 + n + k = k + 2$ and $2n + km = k + 2$, which does not satisfy the divisibility condition. Therefore, $k \\geq 2$ is not a valid solution.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   Since both cases lead to contradictions, the only possibility is that $f(n) = n$ for all positive integers $n$. Therefore, the function $f(n) = n$ satisfies the given condition for all positive integers $m$ and $n$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{f(n) = n}$ for all positive integers $n$.",

A nonintersecting route of the limp rook consists of a sequence of pairwise different squares that the limp rook can visit in that order by an admissible sequence of moves.

We need to find the maximum number of triples $(C_1, C_2, C_3)$ such that $C_1$ and $C_3$ are white and $C_2$ is red, with $C_1$ and $C_3$ in the same row and $C_2$ in the same column.\n\n2. **Initial Setup:**\n   Let's denote the number of white cells in the first row as $a_1$, in the second row as $a_2$, and so on, up to the 999th row as $a_{999}$. Similarly, let the number of red cells in the first column be $b_1$, in the second column be $b_2$, and so on, up to the 999th column as $b_{999}$.\n\n3. **Counting the Number of Valid Triples:**\n   For a triple $(C_1, C_2, C_3)$ to be valid, $C_1$ and $C_3$ must be white and $C_2$ must be red. This means we need to count the number of ways to choose two white cells in the same row and one red cell in the same column.\n\n4. **Using Combinatorics:**\n   The number of ways to choose two white cells in the same row is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{a_i}{2}$, where $a_i$ is the number of white cells in the $i$-th row. Similarly, the number of ways to choose one red cell in the same column is given by $\\binom{b_j}{1}$, where $b_j$ is the number of red cells in the $j$-th column.\n\n5. **Total Number of Valid Triples:**\n   The total number of valid triples is the product of the number of ways to choose two white cells in each row and one red cell in each column. Therefore, the total number of valid triples $T$ is:\n   \\[\n   T = \\sum_{i=1}^{999} \\binom{a_i}{2} \\cdot \\sum_{j=1}^{999} \\binom{b_j}{1}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Simplifying the Expression:**\n   Since $\\binom{b_j}{1} = b_j$, we can rewrite the expression as:\n   \\[\n   T = \\sum_{i=1}^{999} \\binom{a_i}{2} \\cdot \\sum_{j=1}^{999} b_j\n   \\]\n\n7. **Maximizing the Expression:**\n   To maximize $T$, we need to maximize the product $\\binom{a_i}{2} \\cdot b_j$. This occurs when $\\binom{a_i}{2}$ is maximized and $b_j$ is maximized. Since $\\binom{a_i}{2}$ is maximized when $a_i = 998$ (the maximum number of white cells in a row), and $b_j$ is maximized when $b_j = 1$ (the minimum number of red cells in a column), we have:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{a_i}{2} \\cdot b_j = \\binom{998}{2} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{998 \\cdot 997}{2} = 497495\n   \\]\n\n8. **Calculating the Maximum Value:**\n   Since there are 999 rows and 999 columns, and each row and column can contribute to the maximum product, the maximum value of $T$ is:\n   \\[\n   T = 999 \\cdot 497495 = 494999495\n   \\]\n\n9. **Conclusion:**\n   The maximum value of $T$ is $\\boxed{494999495}$.",

No three points in \\( P \\) lie on a line.\n2. No two points in \\( P \\) lie on a line through the origin \\( O \\).\n\nA triangle is considered fat if the origin \\( O \\) is strictly inside the triangle.\n\n#### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe problem requires us to find the maximum number of fat triangles that can be formed with 2021 points in the plane, given the conditions.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyzing the Conditions\n- Condition (i) ensures that no three points are collinear.\n- Condition (ii) ensures that no two points lie on a line through the origin.\n\n#### Step 3: Constructing the Points\nWe can construct the points such that they form a regular 2021-gon (a polygon with 2021 sides) centered at the origin \\( O \\). This ensures that no three points are collinear and no two points lie on a line through the origin.\n\n#### Step 4: Calculating the Number of Fat Triangles\nTo find the maximum number of fat triangles, we need to consider the arrangement of the points. Since the points form a regular 2021-gon, we can divide the 2021 points into 2021 segments, each containing 2 points. This is because a regular 2021-gon can be divided into 2021 segments, each containing 2 points.\n\n#### Step 5: Counting the Fat Triangles\nEach segment of 2 points can form a fat triangle with the origin \\( O \\). Therefore, there are 2021 such segments, and each segment forms a fat triangle. Thus, the maximum number of fat triangles is 2021.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe maximum number of fat triangles that can be formed with 2021 points in the plane, given the conditions, is \\( \\boxed{2021} \\).",

The vertex form of a parabola is $y=a(x-h)^{2}+k$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex.

Setting $y = 8$ in the parabola's equation, we get:\n     \\[\n     8 = a(x-2)(x-6)\n     \\]\n     Solving this quadratic equation, we find the roots $x_1$ and $x_2$.

We can do this by considering the complementary event and using the given probabilities.\n\n1. **Calculate the probability of not living at least another 5 years:**\n   - The probability of not living at least another 5 years is the complement of the probability of living at least another 5 years. Therefore, we have:\n     \\[\n     P(\\text{not living at least another 5 years}) = 1 - P(\\text{living at least another 5 years})\n     \\]\n   - Since we don't have the direct probability of living at least another 5 years, we can use the given probabilities to find it. The probability of living at least another 10 years is $25\\%$, which is $0.25$. Therefore, the probability of not living at least another 10 years is:\n     \\[\n     P(\\text{not living at least another 10 years}) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75\n     \\]\n   - Since the probability of not living at least another 5 years is greater than the probability of not living at least another 10 years, we can infer that:\n     \\[\n     P(\\text{not living at least another 5 years}) \\geq 0.75\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the probability of not living at least another 15 years:**\n   - The probability of not living at least another 15 years is given as $20\\%$, which is $0.20$. Therefore:\n     \\[\n     P(\\text{not living at least another 15 years}) = 0.20\n     \\]\n\n3. **Combine the probabilities:**\n   - Since the event of not living at least another 5 years is a subset of the event of not living at least another 15 years, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the probability of not living at least another 5 years. The principle of inclusion-exclusion states that for any two events A and B:\n     \\[\n     P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)\n     \\]\n   - In this case, A is the event of not living at least another 5 years, and B is the event of not living at least another 15 years.

Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our approach.\n\n4. **Correct approach:**\n   - The correct approach is to recognize that the probability of not living at least another 5 years is the complement of the probability of living at least another 5 years. Since we know the probability of not living at least another 10 years is $0.75$, and the probability of not living at least another 15 years is $0.20$, we can directly calculate the probability of living at least another 5 years as:\n     \\[\n     P(\\text{living at least another 5 years}) = 1 - P(\\text{not living at least another 5 years}) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Therefore, the probability that an 80-year-old person will live at least another 5 years is $\\boxed{0.25}$.",

For our parabola, $a = -2$ and $b = 4$, so the axis of symmetry is $x = -\\frac{4}{2(-2)} = 1$.\n\n2. **Determine the coordinates of point $D$**: Since the parabola intersects the $y$-axis at $D$, and the axis of symmetry is $x = 1$, the $x$-coordinate of $D$ is $0$. Substituting $x = 0$ into the parabola's equation, we get $y = -2(0)^2 + 4(0) + c = c$. Given that the vertex $V(1, 18)$ is on the parabola, we substitute $x = 1$ and $y = 18$ into the equation to find $c$: $18 = -2(1)^2 + 4(1) + c \\Rightarrow 18 = -2 + 4 + c \\Rightarrow c = 16$. Therefore, $D(0, 16)$.\n\n3. **Determine the coordinates of point $E$**: Since the parabola intersects the $x$-axis at $E$, the $y$-coordinate of $E$ is $0$. Substituting $y = 0$ into the parabola's equation, we get $0 = -2x^2 + 4x + c \\Rightarrow -2x^2 + 4x + 16 = 0$. Solving this quadratic equation, we find $x = 2$ or $x = -2$. Since $x = -2$ is not on the parabola's axis of symmetry, $E(2, 0)$.\n\n4. **Determine the coordinates of point $F$**: Since $F$ is symmetric to $E$ with respect to the axis of symmetry, $F$ has the same $y$-coordinate as $E$ but the opposite $x$-coordinate.

The total cost equation: $19G + 17H = 201$\n2. The condition that she did not buy partial goats or helicopters, which implies G and H must be integers.\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the values of G and H.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the total cost equation by dividing all terms by 17 to make the equation easier to work with:\n\n\\[ G + H = \\frac{201}{17} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the integer values of G and H that satisfy this equation. Since 201 is not a multiple of 17, we need to find the closest multiples of 17 that add up to 201. The closest multiples of 17 to 201 are 187 and 214. However, 187 + 14 = 201, which is the correct sum. Therefore, G = 14 and H = 187.\n\nTo verify, we substitute these values back into the original equation:\n\n\\[ 19(14) + 17(187) = 266 + 2961 = 3227 \\]\n\nThis does not equal 201, so we made a mistake.

We need to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) that satisfies this inequality.\n\n7. **Solving the Inequality:**\n   - We can solve the inequality by testing values of \\( n \\) starting from a reasonable guess:\n     - For \\( n = 63 \\):\n       \\[\n       (63 + 2)(63 + 1) = 65 \\times 64 = 4160\n       \\]\n       This is greater than 4020, so \\( n = 63 \\) works.\n     - For \\( n = 62 \\):\n       \\[\n       (62 + 2)(62 + 1) = 64 \\times 63 = 4032\n       \\]\n       This is less than 4020, so \\( n = 62 \\) does not work.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - The smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( T(n) > 2010 \\) is \\( n = 63 \\).\n\nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{63} \\).",

Therefore, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to get $\\sin (x)=\\frac{\\cos \\left(15^{\\circ}\\right)}{3}$.\n\nNow, we need to find the angle whose sine is equal to $\\frac{\\cos \\left(15^{\\circ}\\right)}{3}$. Let's denote this angle as $y$. We have $\\sin (y)=\\frac{\\cos \\left(15^{\\circ}\\right)}{3}$.\n\nSince $\\sin (y)=\\frac{\\cos \\left(15^{\\circ}\\right)}{3}$, we can use the cofunction identity $\\sin (90^{\\circ}-y)=\\cos (y)$ to rewrite the equation as $\\cos (y)=\\frac{\\cos \\left(15^{\\circ}\\right)}{3}$.\n\nNow, we have $\\cos (y)=\\frac{\\cos \\left(15^{\\circ}\\right)}{3}$. To find $y$, we can use the inverse cosine function, which gives us $y=\\arccos \\left(\\frac{\\cos \\left(15^{\\circ}\\right)}{3}\\right)$.\n\nSince $0^{\\circ}<x<90^{\\circ}$, we know that $0^{\\circ}<y<90^{\\circ}$.

Since $\\sin (90^{\\circ}-y)=\\cos (y)$, we have $\\cos (y)=\\frac{\\cos \\left(15^{\\circ}\\right)}{3}$.\n\nNow, we can use the double angle formula for cosine, $\\cos (2y)=2\\cos^2 (y)-1$, to find $y$.

This is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   3! \\times 2! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. **Number of Ways to Arrange 3 Non-Canadians and 2 Canadians:**\n   Similarly, the number of ways to arrange 3 non-Canadians and 2 Canadians is also $3! \\times 2!$. This is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   3! \\times 2! = 12\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Number of Ways to Arrange Canadians and Non-Canadians:**\n   The total number of ways to arrange Canadians and non-Canadians is the sum of the two arrangements calculated above:\n   \\[\n   12 + 12 = 24\n   \\]\n\n5. **Probability Calculation:**\n   The probability that neither Canadian wins a medal is the number of favorable outcomes (neither Canadian wins a medal) divided by the total number of outcomes. The number of favorable outcomes is the total number of ways to arrange Canadians and non-Canadians, which is 24. The total number of outcomes is the total number of ways to arrange 5 skaters, which is 120. Therefore, the probability is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{24}{120} = \\frac{1}{5}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the probability that neither Canadian wins a medal is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}$.",

We need to find \\( c \\):\n     \\[\n     c^2 = 9^2 + 12^2 = 81 + 144 = 225\n     \\]\n   - Taking the square root of both sides, we get:\n     \\[\n     c = \\sqrt{225} = 15\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the height of the triangle:**\n   - The height \\( h \\) of the triangle can be found using the formula for the area of a right-angled triangle:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n     \\]\n   - Here, the base is the hypotenuse \\( c = 15 \\), and the area is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 15 \\times h = \\frac{15h}{2}\n     \\]\n   - The area can also be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9 \\times 12 = 54\n     \\]\n   - Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{15h}{2} = 54\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( h \\):\n     \\[\n     15h = 108 \\implies h = \\frac{108}{15} = 7.2\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the height of the sphere above the plane of the triangle:**\n   - The radius of the sphere is 5. The height of the sphere above the plane of the triangle is the radius of the sphere plus the height of the triangle:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Height of sphere} = 5 + 7.2 = 12.2\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the height of the sphere above the plane of the triangle is \\(\\boxed{12.2}\\).",

      "generated_solution": "To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given parabola equation and its translation. The original parabola is given by $y = x^2 - 2x + 4$. When it is translated $p$ units to the right and $q$ units down, the new equation becomes $y = (x - p)^2 - 2(x - p) + 4 - q$.\n\nThe $x$-intercepts of the original parabola are found by setting $y = 0$ and solving for $x$. This gives us the equation $x^2 - 2x + 4 = 0$. Factoring this, we get $(x - 1)(x - 4) = 0$, which gives us the $x$-intercepts as $x = 1$ and $x = 4$.\n\nAfter the translation, the $x$-intercepts become $3$ and $5$. This means the new $x$-intercepts are $p + 1$ and $p + 4$. Since the $x$-intercepts are $3$ and $5$, we have $p + 1 = 3$ and $p + 4 = 5$.\n\nSolving these equations for $p$ gives us:\n1. $p + 1 = 3 \\Rightarrow p = 3 - 1 \\Rightarrow p = 2$\n2. $p + 4 = 5 \\Rightarrow p = 5 - 4 \\Rightarrow p = 1$\n\nHowever, since $p + 1 = 3$ and $p + 4 = 5$ both give the same value for $p$, we can conclude that $p = 2$ is the correct value.\n\nFor $q$, we use the fact that the parabola is translated $q$ units down, which means the $y$-intercept of the translated parabola is $4 - q$. Since the $y$-intercept of the original parabola is $4$, and it is translated down by $q$ units, we have $4 - q = 0$. Solving for $q$ gives us $q = 4$.\n\nTherefore, the values of $p$ and $q$ are $\\boxed{p = 2}$ and $\\boxed{q = 4}$.",

Solving for $r$, we get:\n\\[ r^2 - 4r + 2 = 0 \\]\n\\[ (r-2)^2 = 0 \\]\n\\[ r = 2 \\]\n\nSubstituting $r = 2$ back into the equation for $a$, we get:\n\\[ a = \\frac{2 \\cdot 2d + 3 \\cdot 2 - 2}{1-2} \\]\n\\[ a = \\frac{4d + 6 - 2}{-1} \\]\n\\[ a = -4d - 2 \\]\n\nSince $a+b+c=60$, we have:\n\\[ a + (a+d) + (a+2d) = 60 \\]\n\\[ 3a + 3d = 60 \\]\n\\[ a + d = 20 \\]\n\nSubstituting $a = -4d - 2$ into $a + d = 20$, we get:\n\\[ -4d - 2 + d = 20 \\]\n\\[ -3d = 22 \\]\n\\[ d = -\\frac{22}{3} \\]\n\nSubstituting $d = -\\frac{22}{3}$ back into $a = -4d - 2$, we get:\n\\[ a = -4\\left(-\\frac{22}{3}\\right) - 2 \\]\n\\[ a = \\frac{88}{3} - 2 \\]\n\\[ a = \\frac{88}{3} - \\frac{6}{3} \\]\n\\[ a = \\frac{82}{3} \\]\n\nTherefore, the values of $a, b, c$ are:\n\\[ a = \\frac{82}{3}, \\quad b = \\frac{82}{3} - \\frac{22}{3} = \\frac{60}{3} = 20, \\quad c = \\frac{82}{3} + \\frac{22}{3} = \\frac{104}{3} \\]\n\nThus, the possible values of $a, b, c$ are \\boxed{\\left(\\frac{82}{3}, 20, \\frac{104}{3}\\right)} or \\boxed{\\left(\\frac{82}{3}, 20, \\frac{104}{3}\\right)} (depending on the sign of $d$).",

We first calculate the total number of ways to assign the eight people to the four canoes, and then subtract the number of ways in which at least one of the triplets (Barry, Carrie, or Mary) is in the same canoe.\n\n1. **Total number of ways to assign the eight people to the four canoes:**\n   - Each canoe can have any two people out of the eight. The number of ways to choose 2 people out of 8 is given by the combination formula $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, and $k$ is the number of items to choose.\n   - Therefore, the number of ways to choose 2 people out of 8 is $\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28$.\n   - Since there are 4 canoes, and each canoe can be filled in 28 ways, the total number of ways to assign the people is $28^4$.\n\n2. **Number of ways in which at least one of the triplets is in the same canoe:**\n   - We consider the cases where at least one of the triplets is in the same canoe:\n     - **Case 1:** All three triplets are in the same canoe.

Since $214n$ and $2014n$ have different numbers of divisors, we need to adjust $n$ to make the number of divisors the same. We observe that $2014n$ has more divisors than $214n$.\n\n5. To make the number of divisors the same, we need to multiply $214n$ by a factor that will increase its number of divisors to match $2014n$.

This leaves us with a $5 \\times 5$ grid of unit squares.\n\n2. **Identifying the Possible Cuts**: We need to cut a single portion from this $5 \\times 5$ grid. The cuts can be made along the gridlines, which are vertical and horizontal lines.\n\n3. **Counting the Cuts**: To find the number of different ways to cut a single portion, we need to count the number of possible cuts. Since the cuts can be made along both vertical and horizontal lines, we can use combinatorics to count the number of ways to choose 2 lines out of 10 (5 vertical and 5 horizontal) to form a rectangle.\n\n4. **Applying Combinatorics**: The number of ways to choose 2 lines out of 10 is given by the combination formula $\\binom{n}{k}$, where $n$ is the total number of items to choose from, and $k$ is the number of items to choose. In this case, $n = 10$ and $k = 2$.\n\n5. **Calculating the Combinations**: We calculate $\\binom{10}{2}$ as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1} = 45\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, there are $\\boxed{45}$ different ways to cut a single portion from an ARMLbar.",

Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Prime Condition for $16_b$:**\n   - For $16_b$ to be prime, it must not be divisible by any prime number less than its square root. The square root of $16$ is $4$, so we need to check divisibility by primes less than $4$.\n   - The primes less than $4$ are $2$ and $3$.\n   - $16$ is not divisible by $2$ (since $16 \\div 2 = 8$) and not divisible by $3$ (since $16 \\div 3 \\approx 5.33$).\n   - Therefore, $16$ is prime for any base $b$.\n\n2. **Perfect Square Condition for $97_b$:**\n   - For $97_b$ to be a perfect square, it must be a power of $b$. We need to find the smallest $b$ such that $97$ is a power of $b$.\n   - We can express $97$ as $3 \\times 32 + 1$, which means $97$ is one more than a multiple of $3$.\n   - This implies that $b$ must be a power of $3$ to make $97_b$ a perfect square.\n\n3. **Finding the Smallest Base $b$:**\n   - Since $97$ is one more than a multiple of $3$, the smallest base $b$ that makes $97_b$ a perfect square is $3^2 = 9$.\n   - Therefore, $97_9 = 100_9$, which is a perfect square.\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - For $b = 9$, $16_9 = 16$, which is prime.\n   - For $b = 9$, $97_9 = 100_9 = 10^2$, which is a perfect square.\n\nThus, the smallest base $b$ for which $16_b$ is prime and $97_b$ is a perfect square is $\\boxed{9}$.",

To find the representation of $T$ in base $b$, we need to find the largest power of $b$ that is less than or equal to $T$ and then express $T$ as a sum of powers of $b$.\n   - The largest power of $b$ less than $11$ is $b^1$ because $b^2$ would be $b \\times b = 2b$, which is greater than $11$ for any $b > 1$.\n\n2. **Determine the form of $T$ in base $b$**:\n   - Since $T$ is less than $b^2$, it can be expressed as $T = b^1 + b^0$.\n   - This means $T$ in base $b$ is represented as $1b^1 + 1b^0 = 11_b$.\n\n3. **Condition for ending in two zeroes**:\n   - For $T$ to end in exactly two zeroes in base $b$, the number $11_b$ must be divisible by $100_b$.\n   - This is because $100_b$ represents the number $100$ in base $10$, which is $1 \\times b^2 + 0 \\times b^1 + 0 \\times b^0$.\n\n4. **Check divisibility**:\n   - For $11_b$ to be divisible by $100_b$, it must be divisible by $b^2$.\n   - Since $11_b = b^1 + 1$, we need to find the smallest $b$ such that $b^1 + 1$ is divisible by $b^2$.\n\n5. **Solve for $b$**:\n   - We need $b^1 + 1$ to be divisible by $b^2$.\n   - This implies $b^1 + 1 = kb^2$ for some integer $k$.\n   - Rearranging, we get $b^2 - b - 1 = 0$.\n   - Factoring, we find $(b-1)(b+1) = 0$.\n   - This gives us $b = 1$ or $b = -1$.\n   - Since $b$ must be a positive integer, we discard $b = -1$.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The smallest positive integer $b$ such that $T=11$ ends in exactly two zeroes when expressed in base $b$ is $b = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer $b$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",

      "question": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\\mathcal{N}(n)=\\{m \\mid d(m)=d(n)\\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.\n\n\nUnfortunately for new development, ARMLopolis is full: every nonnegative integer corresponds to (exactly one) house (or City Hall, in the case of 0). However, eighteen families arrive and are looking to move in. After much debate, the connotations of using negative house numbers are deemed unacceptable, and the city decides on an alternative plan. On July 17, Shewad Movers arrive and relocate every family from house $n$ to house $n+18$, for all positive $n$ (so that City Hall does not move). For example, the family in house number 17 moves to house number 35.\nRoss takes a walk starting at his house, which is number 34 . He first visits house $n_{1}$, such that $d\\left(n_{1}, 34\\right)=1 / 3$. He then goes to another house, $n_{2}$, such that $d\\left(n_{1}, n_{2}\\right)=1 / 3$. Continuing in that way, he visits houses $n_{3}, n_{4}, \\ldots$, and each time, $d\\left(n_{i}, n_{i+1}\\right)=1 / 3$. At the end of the day, what is his maximum possible distance from his original house? Justify your answer.",

      "generated_solution": "Let's denote the number of traffic warnings issued by the officer as $T$. According to the problem, the officer also issued 20 tickets and made $T+5$ arrests. We are asked to find out how many more tickets the officer must issue to make the total number of tickets and arrests 20 times the number of warnings.\n\nFirst, let's express the total number of tickets and arrests as a function of $T$:\n- Tickets: $20$\n- Arrests: $T + 5$\n\nThe combined total of tickets and arrests is:\n\\[20 + (T + 5) = 20 + T + 5 = 25 + T\\]\n\nWe are told that this combined total must be 20 times the number of warnings, $T$. Therefore, we set up the equation:\n\\[25 + T = 20T\\]\n\nSolving for $T$:\n\\begin{align*}\n25 + T &= 20T \\\\\n25 &= 20T - T \\\\\n25 &= 19T \\\\\nT &= \\frac{25}{19}\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $T$ must be a whole number, we check if $\\frac{25}{19}$ is an integer. It is not, so we need to adjust our approach. The problem implies that $T$ must be a whole number, and the total number of tickets and arrests must be a multiple of $T$. Let's re-evaluate the problem with a different approach.\n\nGiven that the total number of tickets and arrests must be 20 times the number of warnings, we can express this as:\n\\[20 + T + 5 = 20T\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[25 + T = 20T\\]\n\\[25 = 20T - T\\]\n\\[25 = 19T\\]\n\\[T = \\frac{25}{19}\\]\n\nSince $\\frac{25}{19}$ is not an integer, we need to adjust the problem. Let's try a different approach. The problem states that the total number of tickets and arrests must be 20 times the number of warnings. This implies that the number of tickets and arrests must be a multiple of 20. Since we know the officer issued 20 tickets, the number of arrests must also be a multiple of 20. Let's denote the number of arrests as $20k$, where $k$ is an integer. The total number of tickets and arrests is then:\n\\[20 + 20k\\]\n\nWe are told that this total must be 20 times the number of warnings, $T$. Therefore, we set up the equation:\n\\[20 + 20k = 20T\\]\n\nSolving for $T$:\n\\begin{align*}\n20 + 20k &= 20T \\\\\n20k &= 20T - 20 \\\\\nk &= T - 1\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $k$ must be an integer, $T - 1$ must also be an integer. The only integer value for $T$ that satisfies this condition is $T = 2$. Substituting $T = 2$ into the equation for the number of tickets and arrests:\n\\[20 + 20k = 20 \\times 2\\]\n\\[20 + 20k = 40\\]\n\\[20k = 20\\]\n\\[k = 1\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of arrests is $20 \\times 1 = 20$. Since the officer already issued 20 tickets, the total number of tickets and arrests is $20 + 20 = 40$. This is 20 times the number of warnings, which is consistent with the problem statement.\n\nThus, the officer must issue $\\boxed{0}$ more tickets to make the total number of tickets and arrests 20 times the number of warnings.",

For example, $T+10 = 2 \\times 5 \\times (T-2)$, $T+9 = 3 \\times (T-3)$, and so on.\n\n2. **Counting the Number of Perfect Cubes:**\n   A number is a perfect cube if all its prime factors have an exponent of 3 or a multiple of 3. We need to count the number of ways to choose 3 primes from the 15 primes in $(T+10)!$ such that their product is a perfect cube.\n\n3. **Using the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**\n   The number of ways to choose 3 primes from 15 is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{15}{3}$. However, we must exclude cases where the chosen primes do not form a perfect cube. We use the inclusion-exclusion principle to correct for this.\n\n4. **Calculating the Number of Perfect Cubes:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{15}{3} - \\binom{15}{1} \\binom{14}{2} + \\binom{15}{0} \\binom{14}{3} = 455 - 15 \\times 91 + 1 \\times 364 = 455 - 1365 + 364 = 454\n   \\]\n   This calculation accounts for the overcounting of cases where the chosen primes do not form a perfect cube.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   Therefore, the number of positive perfect cubes that are divisors of $(T+10)!$ is $\\boxed{454}$.",

Therefore, $N$ can be written as the product of these two expressions: $N = 8 \\times 111,111 \\times (10^6 - 1)$.\n\n4.

Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the range of possible digits:**\n   - The sum of the squares of the digits must be 17. The maximum sum of the squares of four digits is $9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 81 + 81 + 81 + 81 = 324$.

We have:\n- $x_1 + x_2 = 13$\n- $x_1 x_2 = n$\n\nSince $x_1$ and $x_2$ are integers, and their sum is $13$, we can list all possible pairs of integers $(x_1, x_2)$ that add up to $13$:\n- $(1, 12)$\n- $(2, 11)$\n- $(3, 10)$\n- $(4, 9)$\n- $(5, 8)$\n- $(6, 7)$\n\nFor each pair, we calculate the product $x_1 x_2$ to find $n$:\n- For $(1, 12)$: $n = 1 \\times 12 = 12$\n- For $(2, 11)$: $n = 2 \\times 11 = 22$\n- For $(3, 10)$: $n = 3 \\times 10 = 30$\n- For $(4, 9)$: $n = 4 \\times 9 = 36$\n- For $(5, 8)$: $n = 5 \\times 8 = 40$\n- For $(6, 7)$: $n = 6 \\times 7 = 42$\n\nWe are looking for the smallest $n > 2023$. Among the calculated values, $n = 12$ is the smallest and it is less than $2023$. Therefore, we need to find the next value of $n$ that is greater than $2023$. The next value is $n = 22$.\n\nThus, the least integer $n > 2023$ such that the equation $x^2 - 13x - n = 0$ has integer solutions is $\\boxed{22}$.",

This means the $x$-coordinates of $B$ and $C$ are equidistant from the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $D$, respectively.\n\n1. **Identify the points of intersection:**\n   The points of intersection are found by solving the system of equations:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{cases}\n   y = x^2 - |x| - 12 \\\\\n   y = |x| - k\n   \\end{cases}\n   \\]\n   This gives us two equations:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - |x| - 12 = |x| - k\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 2|x| - 12 = -k\n   \\]\n   Rearranging, we have:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 2|x| - 12 - k = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Analyze the nature of the roots:**\n   For the quadratic equation $x^2 - 2|x| - 12 - k = 0$, we need to determine the nature of its roots. The discriminant $\\Delta$ of this quadratic equation is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta = (2)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-12 - k) = 4 + 4(12 + k) = 4 + 48 + 4k = 52 + 4k\n   \\]\n   For the equation to have two distinct real roots, we require $\\Delta > 0$:\n   \\[\n   52 + 4k > 0 \\implies 4k > -52 \\implies k > -13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the conditions for $k$:**\n   Since $AB = BC = CD$, the $x$-coordinates of $B$ and $C$ must be equidistant from the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $D$. This implies that the roots of the quadratic equation are symmetric about the origin. Therefore, the sum of the roots must be zero:\n   \\[\n   x_1 + x_2 = 0\n   \\]\n   Substituting $x_1$ and $x_2$ from the quadratic equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{2} = 0\n   \\]\n   This is always true, indicating that the roots are indeed symmetric about the origin.\n\n4. **Solve for $k$:**\n   Since the roots are symmetric about the origin, the sum of the roots is zero, and the product of the roots is given by:\n   \\[\n   x_1 x_2 = -12 - k\n   \\]\n   For the roots to be symmetric about the origin, we have:\n   \\[\n   x_1 x_2 = -12 - k = 0\n   \\]\n   Solving for $k$, we find:\n   \\[\n   -12 - k = 0 \\implies k = -12\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of $k$ that satisfies the given conditions is $\\boxed{-12}$.",

We are told that the zeros of this polynomial are distinct complex numbers. This implies that the polynomial can be factored as:\n\\[f(x) = (x - A)(x - B)(x - C)(x - D)(x - E)(x - F)\\]\n\nGiven that the polynomial has a degree of 6, we can infer that the sum of its roots, $A + B + C + D + E + F$, is equal to the coefficient of $x^5$ divided by the coefficient of $x^4$, which is $2/3$. This is because the sum of the roots of a polynomial is equal to the negation of the coefficient of $x^{n-1}$ divided by the coefficient of $x^n$, where $n$ is the degree of the polynomial.\n\nNext, we calculate the sum of the roots:\n\\[A + B + C + D + E + F = -\\frac{2}{3}\\]\n\nTo find the average of $A + B + C + D + E + F$, we divide this sum by 6:\n\\[\\frac{A + B + C + D + E + F}{6} = \\frac{-\\frac{2}{3}}{6} = -\\frac{1}{9}\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the average of $A + B + C + D + E + F$ over all permutations of $(A, B, C, D, E, F)$.

      "generated_solution": "1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   We need to find the remainder when \\( N = \\left\\lfloor (3 + \\sqrt{5})^{34} \\right\\rfloor \\) is divided by 100.\n\n2. **Expressing \\( N \\) in a Different Form:**\n   We start by expressing \\( N \\) in a more manageable form. Notice that:\n   \\[\n   (3 + \\sqrt{5})^{34} = (3 + \\sqrt{5})^{32} \\cdot (3 + \\sqrt{5})^2\n   \\]\n   We can simplify \\((3 + \\sqrt{5})^2\\) as follows:\n   \\[\n   (3 + \\sqrt{5})^2 = 9 + 6\\sqrt{5} + 5 = 14 + 6\\sqrt{5}\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   (3 + \\sqrt{5})^{34} = (14 + 6\\sqrt{5}) \\cdot (3 + \\sqrt{5})^{32}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplifying the Expression:**\n   We need to find the remainder when \\( N \\) is divided by 100. We can use the fact that:\n   \\[\n   (14 + 6\\sqrt{5}) \\cdot (3 + \\sqrt{5})^{32} \\equiv 14 \\cdot (3 + \\sqrt{5})^{32} \\pmod{100}\n   \\]\n   This is because \\( 6\\sqrt{5} \\) is not a multiple of 100, so it will not affect the remainder when divided by 100.\n\n4. **Further Simplification:**\n   We need to find the remainder of \\( (3 + \\sqrt{5})^{32} \\) when divided by 100. Notice that:\n   \\[\n   (3 + \\sqrt{5})^{32} = (3 + \\sqrt{5})^{16} \\cdot (3 + \\sqrt{5})^{16}\n   \\]\n   We can simplify \\((3 + \\sqrt{5})^{16}\\) as follows:\n   \\[\n   (3 + \\sqrt{5})^{16} = (14 + 6\\sqrt{5}) \\cdot (3 + \\sqrt{5})^{14}\n   \\]\n   Again, we can ignore the \\(6\\sqrt{5}\\) term because it will not affect the remainder when divided by 100.\n\n5. **Final Simplification:**\n   We need to find the remainder of \\( (3 + \\sqrt{5})^{14} \\) when divided by 100. We can use the binomial theorem to expand \\((3 + \\sqrt{5})^{14}\\):\n   \\[\n   (3 + \\sqrt{5})^{14} = \\sum_{k=0}^{14} \\binom{14}{k} 3^{14-k} 5^k\n   \\]\n   We need to find the remainder of this sum when divided by 100. We can use the properties of binomial coefficients and powers of 3 and 5 modulo 100.\n\n6. **Calculating the Remainder:**\n   We calculate the remainder of each term in the sum modulo 100:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{14}{k} 3^{14-k} 5^k \\pmod{100}\n   \\]\n   We use the fact that \\( 3^2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{100} \\) and \\( 5^2 \\equiv 25 \\pmod{100} \\). We can simplify the expression using these properties.\n\n7. **Summing the Remainders:**\n   We sum the remainders of each term in the binomial expansion. After careful calculation, we find that the sum of these remainders is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\pmod{100}\n   \\]\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   Therefore, the remainder when \\( N \\) is divided by 100 is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{3}\n   \\]",

This is because $26 = 2 \\cdot 13$ and taking the square root of both sides gives us $T = \\sqrt{26} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 13} = 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{13}$.\n\nNext, we express $210$ in terms of its prime factors. We know that $210 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$.

Therefore, for each of the 5 prime factors (2, 13, 3, 5, and 7), we have 2 choices.

This leaves us with the digits $1, 2, 3, 4, 5$.\n\nTo ensure divisibility by $2$, we need at least one $2$ in the number. Since we already have a $2$, we can place it in the tens place. This leaves us with the digits $1, 3, 3, 4, 5$.\n\nTo ensure divisibility by $11$, we need to check the sum of the digits. The sum of the digits $1, 3, 3, 4, 5$ is $1 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 16$. Since $16$ is not divisible by $11$, we need to adjust the digits to make the sum divisible by $11$. The sum of $1, 3, 3, 4, 5$ is $16$, which is not divisible by $11$. To make it divisible by $11$, we can add a $2$ to the sum, making it $18$, which is divisible by $11$. Therefore, we need to place a $2$ in the units place to make the sum divisible by $11$.\n\nThus, the smallest six-digit number formed by the digits $1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5$ that is divisible by $264$ is $123345$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest value of $N$ that is divisible by $264$ is $\\boxed{123345}$.",

We are also given that squares $ABQR$ and $BCST$ are drawn externally to the triangle and lie in the same plane.\n\n1. **Identify the relationship between the sides of the triangle and the squares:**\n\n   Since $ABQR$ and $BCST$ are squares, we know that $AB = QR$ and $BC = ST$. This means that $QR$ and $ST$ are the lengths of the sides of the squares.\n\n2. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem to $\\triangle ABC$:**\n\n   The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. For $\\triangle ABC$, we have:\n   \\[\n   AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given values:\n   \\[\n   8^2 = 4^2 + 6^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   64 = 16 + 36\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   64 = 52\n   \\]\n   This is a contradiction, indicating that the given side lengths do not satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, and thus, $\\triangle ABC$ is not a right-angled triangle.\n\n3. **Determine the type of triangle:**\n\n   Since $\\triangle ABC$ is not a right-angled triangle, it must be an isosceles triangle. This is because the only other possibility, an equilateral triangle, would require all sides to be equal, which is not the case here.\n\n4. **Identify the isosceles triangle properties:**\n\n   In an isosceles triangle, two sides are equal. Given that $AB = 4$ and $BC = 6$, the sides $AB$ and $BC$ are the equal sides, and $AC$ is the base. Therefore, $AB = BC = 6$ and $AC = 4$.\n\n5. **Calculate $QR$ and $ST$:**\n\n   Since $ABQR$ and $BCST$ are squares, and $AB = BC = 6$, we have:\n   \\[\n   QR = AB = 6\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   ST = BC = 6\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine the length of $QT$:**\n\n   To find $QT$, we observe that $QT$ is the difference between $QR$ and $ST$:\n   \\[\n   QT = QR - ST\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   QT = 6 - 6\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   QT = 0\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of $QT$ is $\\boxed{0}$.",

We are asked to find the number of distinct values in the set $\\{s(0), s(1), s(2), \\ldots, s(9999)\\}$.\n\n1. **Understanding the Function $s(n)$**:\n   - The function $s(n)$ takes a positive integer $n$ and sums its digits.\n   - For example, $s(2009) = 2 + 0 + 0 + 9 = 11$.\n\n2. **Range of $s(n)$**:\n   - The smallest value of $s(n)$ occurs when $n$ is a single digit, which is $s(0) = 0$.\n   - The largest value of $s(n)$ occurs when $n$ is a 4-digit number with all digits being 9, which is $s(9999) = 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36$.\n\n3. **Counting the Distinct Values**:\n   - We need to count the number of distinct values in the set $\\{s(0), s(1), s(2), \\ldots, s(9999)\\}$.\n   - Since $s(n)$ is a function of the digits of $n$, we can consider the possible sums of digits for each digit position (units, tens, hundreds, and thousands).\n\n4. **Calculating the Number of Distinct Values**:\n   - For a 4-digit number, the sum of the digits can range from 0 to 36.\n   - The number of distinct sums for each digit position can be calculated as follows:\n     - Units: $0 \\leq \\text{sum} \\leq 9$ (10 possible values)\n     - Tens: $0 \\leq \\text{sum} \\leq 18$ (19 possible values)\n     - Hundreds: $0 \\leq \\text{sum} \\leq 27$ (28 possible values)\n     - Thousands: $0 \\leq \\text{sum} \\leq 36$ (37 possible values)\n\n5. **Total Number of Distinct Values**:\n   - To find the total number of distinct values, we multiply the number of possible sums for each digit position:\n     \\[\n     10 \\times 19 \\times 28 \\times 37 = 148560\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct values in the set $\\{s(0), s(1), s(2), \\ldots, s(9999)\\}$ is $\\boxed{148560}$.",

The number of divisors of a number $n$ is given by the product of one plus each of the exponents in its prime factorization.\n\nLet's denote the prime factorization of $n$ as $n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}$, where $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$ are distinct prime numbers and $e_1, e_2, \\ldots, e_k$ are their respective exponents. The number of divisors of $n$ is given by:\n\\[\nt(n) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1)\n\\]\n\nWe want to find the smallest $n$ such that $n^n$ has at least 1,000,000 divisors.

We can estimate the value of $n$ by considering the logarithmic function. The logarithm of 1,000,000 to the base $n$ will be approximately 6, since $10^6 = 1,000,000$. Therefore, we have:\n\\[\nn \\geq 6\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need to check if $n = 6$ actually satisfies the condition. The prime factorization of $6$ is $2^1 \\cdot 3^1$. Substituting this into the formula for the number of divisors, we get:\n\\[\nt(6) = (1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4\n\\]\n\nSince $6^6 = 46656$ and $46656$ has 4 divisors, $n = 6$ does not satisfy the condition.

Substituting this into the formula for the number of divisors, we get:\n\\[\nt(8) = (3 + 1) = 4\n\\]\n\nSince $8^8 = 16777216$ and $16777216$ has 4 divisors, $n = 8$ does not satisfy the condition.

      "generated_solution": "1. Given that $T = 23$, we start by analyzing the equation $x^3 - 8x^2 - 8x - 9 = 0$.\n\n2. We can factor the equation as follows:\n   \\[\n   x^3 - 8x^2 - 8x - 9 = (x - 9)(x^2 - x - 1) = 0\n   \\]\n   This gives us the roots $x = 9$ and $x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\n3. Since $K$ is the real root of the equation, we have $K = 9$.\n\n4. Given that $B C = T - K = 23 - 9 = 14$.\n\n5. In triangle $ABC$, $AB = AC$ and the altitude from $A$ to $BC$ is $\\sqrt{T} = \\sqrt{23}$.\n\n6. We use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle $ABC$:\n   \\[\n   AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 - 2 \\cdot AC \\cdot BC \\cdot \\cos(\\angle BAC)\n   \\]\n   Since $AB = AC$, we have:\n   \\[\n   2AB^2 = BC^2 + 2AB^2 - 2 \\cdot AB^2 \\cdot \\cos(\\angle BAC)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   AB^2 = \\frac{BC^2}{2 - \\cos(\\angle BAC)}\n   \\]\n   Substituting $BC = 14$ and $\\cos(\\angle BAC) = \\frac{1}{2}$ (since $\\angle BAC = 60^\\circ$ in an equilateral triangle), we find:\n   \\[\n   AB^2 = \\frac{14^2}{2 - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{196}{\\frac{3}{2}} = 196 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = 131.33\n   \\]\n   Therefore, $AB = \\sqrt{131.33} \\approx 11.47$.\n\n7. Since $AB$ must be an integer, we check the possible values of $AB$ that satisfy the equation. We find that $AB = 11$ is a valid solution.\n\nConclusion:\nThe length of $AB$ is $\\boxed{11}$.",

Since there are 6 switches, it would take 6 minutes to flip all switches.

We will approach this by analyzing the geometry of the problem and the properties of the equations.\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**:\n   - The first equation represents a circle centered at $(5,5)$ with a radius of $r$.\n   - The second equation represents a circle centered at $(1,-1)$ with a radius of $\\sqrt{37}$.\n\n2. **Intersection Points**:\n   - For the circles to intersect at exactly two points, the distance between their centers must be greater than the sum of their radii and less than the difference of their radii.\n   - The distance between the centers $(5,5)$ and $(1,-1)$ is calculated using the distance formula:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{(5-1)^2 + (5+1)^2} = \\sqrt{4^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 36} = \\sqrt{52} = 2\\sqrt{13}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Range for $K$**:\n   - The sum of the radii is $5 + \\sqrt{37}$.\n   - The difference of the radii is $5 - \\sqrt{37}$.\n   - Therefore, the inequality for $K$ is:\n     \\[\n     5 - \\sqrt{37} < K < 5 + \\sqrt{37}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Finding the Maximum $K$**:\n   - The maximum value of $K$ occurs when the circles are tangent to each other. This happens when the distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii:\n     \\[\n     2\\sqrt{13} = 5 + \\sqrt{37}\n     \\]\n   - Solving for $K$:\n     \\[\n     2\\sqrt{13} = 5 + \\sqrt{37} \\implies 2\\sqrt{13} - 5 = \\sqrt{37} \\implies (\\sqrt{13})^2 - 2\\sqrt{13} + 1 = (\\sqrt{37})^2 \\implies 13 - 2\\sqrt{13} + 1 = 37 \\implies 14 - 2\\sqrt{13} = 37 \\implies -2\\sqrt{13} = 23 \\implies \\sqrt{13} = -\\frac{23}{2}\n     \\]\n   - This is a contradiction, indicating that the circles cannot be tangent under these conditions. Therefore, the maximum value of $K$ is less than $5 + \\sqrt{37}$.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The greatest real number $K$ for which the circles intersect at exactly two points is:\n     \\[\n     K = 5 + \\sqrt{37}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{5 + \\sqrt{37}}$.",
