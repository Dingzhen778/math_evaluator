If $N$ is a multiple of 25, the greedy algorithm will choose 25-cent coins until it reaches $N$, resulting in a collection of $N/25$ coins. However, we can achieve the same total value with fewer coins by choosing 10-cent coins instead of 25-cent coins. For example, if $N = 25$, the greedy algorithm would choose 1 25-cent coin, but we can achieve the same total value with 2 10-cent coins.\n\n2. If $N$ is a multiple of 10 but not a multiple of 25, the greedy algorithm will choose 10-cent coins until it reaches $N$, resulting in a collection of $N/10$ coins. However, we can achieve the same total value with fewer coins by choosing 1-cent coins instead of 10-cent coins. For example, if $N = 30$, the greedy algorithm would choose 3 10-cent coins, but we can achieve the same total value with 1 10-cent coin and 2 1-cent coins.\n\n3.
