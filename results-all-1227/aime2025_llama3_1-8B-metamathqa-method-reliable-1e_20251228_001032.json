      "generated_solution": "We can solve this problem using complementary counting.\nFirst, we count the total number of subsets of 16 chairs that can be selected.\nThis is simply $2^{16}$, since each chair can either be included or excluded in each subset.\nNext, we count the number of subsets where two people sit next to each other.\nTo do this, we count the number of ways to choose 2 people out of 8 to sit next to each other, and then count the number of ways to choose the remaining 6 people to sit in the remaining 14 chairs.\nThe number of ways to choose 2 people out of 8 is $\\binom{8}{2} = 28$.\nThe number of ways to choose the remaining 6 people out of 14 is $\\binom{14}{6} = 3003$.\nSo, the number of subsets where two people sit next to each other is $28 \\times 3003 = 84084$.\nFinally, we subtract this from the total number of subsets to find the number of subsets where no two people sit next to each other: $2^{16} - 84084$.\nTo find the remainder when this number is divided by 1000, we can use the property that $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ implies $a^n \\equiv b^n \\pmod{m}$.\nSince $2^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1000}$, we have $(2^{16} - 84084) \\equiv 1 - 84084 \\equiv -84083 \\equiv 117 \\pmod{1000}$.\nTherefore, the remainder when $N$ is divided by 1000 is $\\boxed{117}$.\nThe answer is: 117",
