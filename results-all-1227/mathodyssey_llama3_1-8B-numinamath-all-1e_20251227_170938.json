This means we are looking for the largest $n$ such that the product is divisible by $(n+50)^2$.\n\n1. **Understanding the Product:**\n   The product of the numbers from $n$ to $n+100$ can be written as:\n   \\[\n   n(n+1)(n+2)\\cdots(n+100)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divisibility Condition:**\n   We need this product to be divisible by $(n+50)^2$.

For $n = 50$:\n   \\[\n   (50+100)! = (150)!\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (50+50)^2 = 100^2 = 10000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (150)! \\geq 10000\n   \\]\n   Since $(150)!$ is indeed much larger than $10000$, $n = 50$ satisfies the condition.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   The largest positive integer $n$ such that the product of the numbers $n, n+1, n+2, \\ldots, n+100$ is divisible by the square of one of these numbers is $\\boxed{50}$.",

The number of digits in $x^3$ is determined by the formula $n = \\left\\lceil \\log_{10}(x^3) \\right\\rceil + 1$. This formula accounts for the fact that the number of digits in a number is one more than the logarithm of the number to the base 10, rounded up to the nearest whole number.\n\nGiven that $x$ is a positive integer with $m$ digits, we can express $x$ as $x = 10^m$. Substituting this into the formula for $n$, we get:\n\n\\[\nn = \\left\\lceil \\log_{10}((10^m)^3) \\right\\rceil + 1\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the expression inside the logarithm:\n\n\\[\nn = \\left\\lceil \\log_{10}(10^{3m}) \\right\\rceil + 1\n\\]\n\nSince $\\log_{10}(10^{3m}) = 3m \\log_{10}(10) = 3m \\cdot 1 = 3m$, we have:\n\n\\[\nn = \\left\\lceil 3m \\right\\rceil + 1\n\\]\n\nThis means that $n$ is one more than three times the number of digits in $x$. Therefore, the sum $m + n$ is:\n\n\\[\nm + n = m + (3m + 1) = 4m + 1\n\\]\n\nGiven the options for $m + n$, we need to find which one cannot be expressed in the form $4m + 1$. Let's examine each option:\n\n- For option A, $m + n = 2022$, we can set $4m + 1 = 2022$ and solve for $m$:\n  \\[\n  4m + 1 = 2022 \\implies 4m = 2021 \\implies m = \\frac{2021}{4} = 505.25\n  \\]\n  Since $m$ must be an integer, option A is not possible.\n\n- For option B, $m + n = 2023$, we can set $4m + 1 = 2023$ and solve for $m$:\n  \\[\n  4m + 1 = 2023 \\implies 4m = 2022 \\implies m = \\frac{2022}{4} = 505.5\n  \\]\n  Since $m$ must be an integer, option B is not possible.\n\n- For option C, $m + n = 2024$, we can set $4m + 1 = 2024$ and solve for $m$:\n  \\[\n  4m + 1 = 2024 \\implies 4m = 2023 \\implies m = \\frac{2023}{4} = 505.75\n  \\]\n  Since $m$ must be an integer, option C is not possible.\n\n- For option D, $m + n = 2025$, we can set $4m + 1 = 2025$ and solve for $m$:\n  \\[\n  4m + 1 = 2025 \\implies 4m = 2024 \\implies m = \\frac{2024}{4} = 506\n  \\]\n  Since $m$ is an integer, option D is possible.\n\nTherefore, the options that cannot be the value of $m + n$ are A, B, and C.

Then, we have $n = p + 1$.\n\n   Substituting $n = p + 1$ into $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \\frac{(p+1)(p+2)}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   For $\\frac{(p+1)(p+2)}{2}$ to be a prime number, $(p+1)(p+2)$ must be even, which means $p+1$ and $p+2$ must have the same parity (both even or both odd). Since $p$ is a prime number, $p$ is odd, making $p+1$ even and $p+2$ odd. Therefore, $(p+1)(p+2)$ is even, which is a contradiction because the product of an even number and an odd number is even, not prime.\n\n4. **Step 4: Conclude that there is no such $n$.**\n\n   Since we have reached a contradiction, there is no positive integer $n$ that satisfies both conditions. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{No such } n}$.",

prime numbers, we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Identify the range of $p$:**\n   - Since $p^p+1$ must have no more than 19 digits, we consider $p$ such that $p^p \\leq 10^{18}$.\n   - The largest prime number less than $10^{18}$ is $10^{17} - 1$.\n   - Therefore, $p$ must be less than or equal to $10^{17}$.\n\n2. **Check for prime numbers of the form $p^p+1$ within the range:**\n   - We need to check each prime number $p$ from 2 to $10^{17}$ to see if $p^p+1$ is also a prime number.\n   - This involves checking each prime number and its corresponding $p^p+1$ to see if it is prime.\n\n3.

Let's break down the solution step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We are given three three-digit numbers $a, b, c$ such that $a + b + c = 2005$.\n   - We need to find the maximum value of $S(a) + S(b) + S(c)$, where $S(n)$ denotes the sum of the digits of $n$.\n\n2. **Initial Observations:**\n   - Since $a, b, c$ are three-digit numbers, their values range from 100 to 999.\n   - The sum of the digits of a three-digit number ranges from 1 (for 100) to 27 (for 999).\n\n3. **Maximizing $S(a) + S(b) + S(c)$:**\n   - To maximize $S(a) + S(b) + S(c)$, we should aim to maximize the sum of the digits of $a, b, c$.\n   - The maximum sum of the digits of a three-digit number is 27, so we should try to have $a, b, c$ as close to 999 as possible.\n\n4. **Finding the Maximum Sum:**\n   - Let's consider the maximum possible sum of the digits for each number:\n     - $S(999) = 9 + 9 + 9 = 27$\n   - Since $a + b + c = 2005$, we can distribute the digits to maximize the sum of their digits:\n     - If $a = 999$, then $b + c = 2005 - 999 = 1006$.\n     - The maximum sum of the digits for $b$ and $c$ would be $S(b) + S(c) = 27 + 27 = 54$.\n\n5. **Verifying the Maximum Sum:**\n   - To verify, let's check if there are any other combinations that can achieve the same sum:\n     - If $a = 999$, then $b + c = 1006$.\n     - The maximum sum of the digits for $b$ and $c$ would be $S(b) + S(c) = 27 + 27 = 54$.\n     - This is the maximum possible sum for $S(a) + S(b) + S(c)$ given the constraints.\n\n6. **Counting the Number of Sets:**\n   - Since $a = 999$ and $b + c = 1006$, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the digits of $b$ and $c$ such that their sum is 27.\n   - The possible combinations for $b$ and $c$ are:\n     - $b = 100, c = 906$\n     - $b = 101, c = 905$\n     - $b = 102, c = 904$\n     - $b = 103, c = 903$\n     - $b = 104, c = 902$\n     - $b = 105, c = 901$\n     - $b = 106, c = 900$\n     - $b = 107, c = 899$\n     - $b = 108, c = 898$\n     - $b = 109, c = 897$\n     - $b = 110, c = 896$\n     - $b = 111, c = 895$\n     - $b = 112, c = 894$\n     - $b = 113, c = 893$\n     - $b = 114, c = 892$\n     - $b = 115, c = 891$\n     - $b = 116, c = 890$\n     - $b = 117, c = 889$\n     - $b = 118, c = 888$\n     - $b = 119, c = 887$\n     - $b = 120, c = 886$\n     - $b = 121, c = 885$\n     - $b = 122, c = 884$\n     - $b = 123, c = 883$\n     - $b = 124, c = 882$\n     - $b = 125, c = 881$\n     - $b = 126, c = 880$\n     - $b = 127, c = 879$\n     - $b = 128, c = 878$\n     - $b = 129, c = 877$\n     - $b = 130, c = 876$\n     - $b = 131, c = 875$\n     - $b = 132, c = 874$\n     - $b = 133, c = 873$\n     - $b = 134, c = 872$\n     - $b = 135, c = 871$\n     - $b = 136, c = 870$\n     - $b = 137, c = 869$\n     - $b = 138, c = 868$\n     - $b = 139, c = 867$\n     - $b = 140, c = 866$\n     - $b = 141, c = 865$\n     - $b = 142, c = 864$\n     - $b = 143, c = 863$\n     - $b = 144, c = 862$\n     - $b = 145, c = 861$\n     - $b = 146, c = 860$\n     - $b = 147, c = 859$\n     - $b = 148, c = 858$\n     - $b = 149, c = 857$\n     - $b = 150, c = 856$\n     - $b = 151, c = 855$\n     - $b = 152, c = 854$\n     - $b = 153, c = 853$\n     - $b = 154, c = 852$\n     - $b = 155, c = 851$\n     - $b = 156, c = 850$\n     - $b = 157, c = 849$\n     - $b = 158, c = 848$\n     - $b = 159, c = 847$\n     - $b = 160, c = 846$\n     - $b = 161, c = 845$\n     - $b = 162, c = 844$\n     - $b = 163, c = 843$\n     - $b = 164, c = 842$\n     - $b = 165, c = 841$\n     - $b = 166, c = 840$\n     - $b = 167, c = 839$\n     - $b = 168, c = 838$\n     - $b = 169, c = 837$\n     - $b = 170, c = 836$\n     - $b = 171, c = 835$\n     - $b = 172, c = 834$\n     - $b = 173, c = 833$\n     - $b = 174, c = 832$\n     - $b = 175, c = 831$\n     - $b = 176, c = 830$\n     - $b = 177, c = 829$\n     - $b = 178, c = 828$\n     - $b = 179, c = 827$\n     - $b = 180, c = 826$\n     - $b = 181, c = 825$\n     - $b = 182, c = 824$\n     - $b = 183, c = 823$\n     - $b = 184, c = 822$\n     - $b = 185, c = 821$\n     - $b = 186, c = 820$\n     - $b = 187, c = 819$\n     - $b = 188, c = 818$\n     - $b = 189, c = 817$\n     - $b = 190, c = 816$\n     - $b = 191, c = 815$\n     - $b = 192, c = 814$\n     - $b = 193, c = 813$\n     - $b = 194, c = 812$\n     - $b = 195, c = 811$\n     - $b = 196, c = 810$\n     - $b = 197, c = 809$\n     - $b = 198, c = 808$\n     - $b = 199, c = 807$\n     - $b = 200, c = 806$\n     - $b = 201, c = 805$\n     - $b = 202, c = 804$\n     - $b = 203, c = 803$\n     - $b = 204, c = 802$\n     - $b = 205, c = 801$\n     - $b = 206, c = 800$\n     - $b = 207, c = 799$\n     - $b = 208, c = 798$\n     - $b = 209, c = 797$\n     -",

Since $2005$ is the 2005th number in the sequence, we can determine the position of $a_{5n}$ by finding the position of $2005$ in the sequence.\n\n   - The first number in the sequence is $1$, the second number is $2$, and so on, up to the fifth number being $5$.\n   - After the fifth number, the sequence repeats with the digits $1$ and $1$, then $1$ and $2$, and so on, up to $5$ and $5$.\n\n   Since $2005$ is the 2005th number in the sequence, we can find the position of $a_{5n}$ by dividing $2005$ by $5$ and finding the remainder.\n\n   - $2005 \\div 5 = 401$ with a remainder of $0$.\n\n   This means that $a_{5n}$ is the 401st number in the sequence of auspicious numbers that repeat every 5 numbers.\n\n3. **Find the 401st number in the sequence:**\n\n   - The sequence repeats every 5 numbers, so we need to find the 401st number in the sequence.\n   - The first number in the sequence is $1$, the second number is $2$, and so on, up to the fifth number being $5$.\n   - The sixth number is $11$, the seventh number is $12$, and so on, up to the tenth number being $15$.\n   - The eleventh number is $22$, the twelfth number is $23$, and so on, up to the fifteenth number being $25$.\n   - The sixteenth number is $33$, the seventeenth number is $34$, and so on, up to the twentieth number being $55$.\n\n   Since $401$ is greater than $20$, we need to find the 401st number in the sequence of numbers that repeat every 5 numbers.

Let's denote these roots as $a$, $b$, and $c$. \n\n1. **Sum of the Roots**: The sum of the roots of a cubic equation $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0$ is given by $-\\frac{b}{a}$.

This is because $2^3 = 8$, which is the smallest power of $2$ greater than $3$, and $2^{2000}$ is the largest power of $2$ less than or equal to $2000$.\n\nTherefore, the values of $n$ are $2^4 - 1 = 15$, $2^5 - 1 = 31$, $2^6 - 1 = 63$, $\\ldots$, $2^{2000} - 1 = 2^{2000} - 1$.\n\nThe sum of these values of $n$ is:\n\\begin{align*}\n15 + 31 + 63 + \\ldots + (2^{2000} - 1) &= 2^4 - 1 + 2^5 - 1 + 2^6 - 1 + \\ldots + 2^{2000} - 1 \\\\\n&= (2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 + \\ldots + 2^{2000}) - 2000 \\\\\n&= 2^{2001} - 2^4 - 2000 \\\\\n&= 2^{2001} - 16 - 2000 \\\\\n&= 2^{2001} - 2016.\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the sum of all such $n$ satisfying the given condition is $\\boxed{2^{2001} - 2016}$.",

Let's denote the number as $N$ and its digits as $a, b, c, d, e, f$ from left to right. The number can be represented as $N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d + 1000e + 100f$.\n\nGiven that each pair of adjacent digits forms a perfect square, we have the following conditions:\n1. $a^2 + b^2 = 100$\n2. $b^2 + c^2 = 100$\n3. $c^2 + d^2 = 100$\n4. $d^2 + e^2 = 100$\n5. $e^2 + f^2 = 100$\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce that $a = c = e$ and $b = d = f$. This is because the sum of the squares of the digits must be 100, and the only way to achieve this with the same digit in the tens place is if the digit is 10, which is not possible since we are dealing with positive integers. Therefore, $a = c = e$ and $b = d = f$ must be the same.\n\nGiven that $a^2 + b^2 = 100$, we can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ by considering the perfect squares that add up to 100. The perfect squares less than 100 are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and 81. We need to find pairs of these squares that add up to 100. The pairs are:\n- $1 + 99 = 100$\n- $4 + 96 = 100$\n- $9 + 91 = 100$\n- $16 + 84 = 100$\n- $25 + 75 = 100$\n- $36 + 64 = 100$\n- $49 + 51 = 100$\n- $64 + 36 = 100$\n- $81 + 19 = 100$\n\nHowever, since $a = c = e$ and $b = d = f$, we only need to consider the pairs where $a = b = c = d = e = f$. The only pair that satisfies this condition is $9 + 91 = 100$, which gives us $a = b = c = d = e = f = 9$.\n\nTherefore, the number $N$ is $999999$. The sum of all positive integers satisfying the given conditions is $999999$.\n\nHence, the final answer is $\\boxed{999999}$.",

Since the last four digits of $N$ are 2022, we can express $N$ as $N = 10000a + 2022$, where $a$ is a digit (0-9).\n\n2. We are given that $N$ is divisible by 2003. Therefore, we can write the equation $10000a + 2022 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2003}$.\n\n3. Simplifying the equation, we get $2022 \\equiv -10000a \\pmod{2003}$.\n\n4. To find the smallest non-negative value of $a$, we need to find the smallest $a$ such that $-10000a$ is a multiple of 2003.\n\n5.

Since $p, q, r$ are prime numbers, we can assume without loss of generality that $p \\leq q \\leq r$.\n2. Given $p+q+r=1000$, we can deduce that $r \\geq 333$ because $p, q, r$ are prime numbers and the smallest prime number is 2. Therefore, $r \\geq 333$.\n3. Since $r$ is a prime number and $r \\geq 333$, the only possible value for $r$ is 337 (as 337 is the smallest prime number greater than or equal to 333).\n4. Now, we have $p+q=1000-337=663$.\n5. Since $p, q$ are prime numbers and $p \\leq q$, the only possible value for $p$ is 2 (as 2 is the smallest prime number).\n6. Therefore, $q=663-2=661$.\n7. Now, we have $p=2$, $q=661$, and $r=337$.\n8. We need to find the remainder when $p^{2} q^{2} r^{2}$ is divided by 48.\n9. First, calculate $p^{2} q^{2} r^{2} = 2^{2} \\cdot 661^{2} \\cdot 337^{2}$.\n10. Simplify the expression: $4 \\cdot 661^{2} \\cdot 337^{2}$.\n11. Since $661$ and $337$ are prime numbers, their squares are not divisible by 2, 3, or 4. Therefore, the remainder when $4 \\cdot 661^{2} \\cdot 337^{2}$ is divided by 48 is the same as the remainder when $4$ is divided by 48.\n12. Calculate the remainder: $4 \\div 48 = 0$ with a remainder of $4$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $p^{2} q^{2} r^{2}$ is divided by 48 is $\\boxed{4}$.",

The Fibonacci sequence is known to have the property that $F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n$ for $n \\geq 1$.\n\nNow, let's consider the given equation $5F_x - 3F_y = 1$. We can rewrite this as $5F_x = 3F_y + 1$. Since $F_x$ and $F_y$ are Fibonacci numbers, we can express $F_x$ and $F_y$ in terms of the Fibonacci sequence. However, we need to find the specific values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy this equation.\n\nGiven the properties of the Fibonacci sequence, we can deduce that $F_x$ and $F_y$ must be such that their difference is 1, because $5F_x - 3F_y = 1$ implies that $5F_x$ is 1 more than $3F_y$. This means $F_x$ and $F_y$ must be consecutive Fibonacci numbers.\n\nThe consecutive Fibonacci numbers that differ by 1 are $(F_{n+1}, F_n)$ for any $n$. Therefore, the possible pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are $(n+1, n)$ for any $n$.\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, the possible values for $n$ are $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 19$. This gives us 19 possible pairs $(x, y)$.\n\nTherefore, the number of sets of positive integers $(x, y)$ that satisfy $5F_x - 3F_y = 1$ is $\\boxed{19}$.",

      "generated_solution": "To solve the problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $n$ for which there exists a positive integer $k \\geq 2$ such that for positive integers $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k$ satisfying the given conditions, the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} x_i x_{i+1} = n$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} x_i = 2019$.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We are given two conditions:\n     - $\\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} x_i x_{i+1} = n$\n     - $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} x_i = 2019$\n   - We need to find the number of such $n$.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Conditions:**\n   - The first condition implies that the product of consecutive terms in the sequence is equal to $n$.\n   - The second condition implies that the sum of all terms in the sequence is $2019$.\n\n3. **Finding the Number of Terms:**\n   - Let's denote the number of terms as $k$.

      "generated_solution": "To solve the problem, we need to understand the properties of polynomials and their roots. A polynomial with integer coefficients can have complex roots, but for the purpose of this problem, we are interested in the real roots. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that a polynomial of degree n has exactly n roots, including complex roots. However, we are interested in the maximum number of real roots in the interval (0,1).\n\n1. **Understanding the Polynomial**: The polynomial is given as a polynomial of degree 2022 with a leading coefficient of 1. This means the polynomial can be written as:\n   \\[\n   P(x) = x^{2022} + a_{2021}x^{2021} + a_{2020}x^{2020} + \\cdots + a_1x + a_0\n   \\]\n   where \\(a_i\\) are integers.\n\n2. **Behavior at the Interval Boundaries**: At the boundaries of the interval (0,1), the polynomial can have at most one root each. This is because the polynomial can change sign at these points, indicating a root. For example, if \\(P(0) = 0\\), then \\(x = 0\\) is a root. Similarly, if \\(P(1) = 0\\), then \\(x = 1\\) is a root.\n\n3. **Intermediate Value Theorem**: The Intermediate Value Theorem states that if a continuous function changes sign over an interval, it must have at least one root in that interval. Since the polynomial is continuous, it can have at most one root in each subinterval of (0,1).\n\n4. **Dividing the Interval**: The interval (0,1) can be divided into 2022 subintervals of the form \\((\\frac{k}{2022}, \\frac{k+1}{2022})\\) for \\(k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 2021\\). Each subinterval can have at most one root.\n\n5. **Counting the Roots**: Since each subinterval can have at most one root, and there are 2022 subintervals, the maximum number of roots in the interval (0,1) is 2022.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of roots the polynomial can have in the interval (0,1) is \\(\\boxed{2022}\\).",

Since $C = 90^\\circ$ (as $O$ is the origin and $A$ and $B$ lie on the x-axis and y-axis respectively), we have $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 \\times 8 \\times \\sin 90^\\circ = 16$.\n   - Therefore, the coordinates of $I$ are $I = \\left( \\frac{4+8+4\\sqrt{3}}{16}, \\frac{4+8-4\\sqrt{3}}{16} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{16}{16}, \\frac{12-4\\sqrt{3}}{16} \\right) = (1, \\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}}{4})$.\n\n3. **Find the equation of the circle $\\\\Gamma$:**\n   - The equation of a circle with center $(h, k)$ and radius $r$ is $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$.\n   - Since $\\\\Gamma$ passes through $A(4,4\\sqrt{3})$ and $B(8,0)$, we can use these points to find the center and radius of $\\\\Gamma$.\n   - The midpoint $M$ of $AB$ is $M = \\left( \\frac{4+8}{2}, \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}+0}{2} \\right) = (6, 2\\sqrt{3})$.\n   - The slope of $AB$ is $k_{AB} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}-0}{4-8} = -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n   - The slope of the perpendicular bisector of $AB$ is the negative reciprocal of $k_{AB}$, which is $2$.\n   - The equation of the perpendicular bisector of $AB$ is $y - 2\\sqrt{3} = 2(x - 6)$, which simplifies to $y = 2x - 2\\sqrt{3} - 12$.\n   - The center of $\\\\Gamma$ is the intersection of the perpendicular bisector and the line $AB$, which is $(6, 2\\sqrt{3})$.\n   - The radius $r$ of $\\\\Gamma$ is the distance from $A$ to the center, which is $r = \\sqrt{(6-4)^2 + (2\\sqrt{3}-4\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{4 + (2\\sqrt{3}-4\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 12} = 4$.\n\n4. **Find the equation of circle $\\\\odot I$:**\n   - The equation of $\\\\odot I$ is $(x-1)^2 + \\left(y - \\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2 = r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of $\\\\odot I$.\n   - The radius $r$ of $\\\\odot I$ is the distance from $I$ to $O$, which is $r = \\sqrt{(1-0)^2 + \\left(\\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}}{4}-0\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{9-12\\sqrt{3}+12}{16}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{25-12\\sqrt{3}}{16}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{25-12\\sqrt{3}}}{4}$.\n\n5. **Find the equation of the circle passing through $P$ and $Q$:**\n   - The equation of the circle passing through $P$ and $Q$ is $(x-6)^2 + (y-2\\sqrt{3})^2 = 16$.\n\n6. **Find the intersection points $P$ and $Q$:**\n   - Solving the system of equations $\\begin{cases} (x-6)^2 + (y-2\\sqrt{3})^2 = 16 \\\\ (x-1)^2 + \\left(y - \\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25-12\\sqrt{3}}{16} \\end{cases}$, we find the coordinates of $P$ and $Q$.\n\n7. **Find the radius of circle $\\\\Gamma$:**\n   - The radius of circle $\\\\Gamma$ is the distance from the center of $\\\\Gamma$ to the center of $\\\\odot I$, which is $r = \\sqrt{(6-1)^2 + (2\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}}{4})^2} = \\sqrt{25 + \\left(2\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + \\left(2\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + \\left(2\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + \\left(2\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + \\left(2\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + \\left(2\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + \\left(2\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + \\left(2\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + \\left(2\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + \\left(2\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + \\left(2\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + \\left(2\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + \\left(2\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + \\left(2\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + \\left(2\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + \\left(2\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + \\left(2\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + \\left(2\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + \\left(2\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + \\left(2\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{3-2\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^",

A tetrahedron is a polyhedron with a triangular base and three triangular faces that meet at a common vertex. Each face of the tetrahedron is a triangle, and the edges of the tetrahedron are the line segments connecting the vertices of the triangles.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem states that each face of the tetrahedron is not an isosceles triangle. This means that no two sides of any face are equal in length. \n\n2. **Analyzing the Faces**: Since each face is not isosceles, each face must have three distinct edge lengths. This is because if two sides were equal, the triangle would be isosceles, which contradicts the given condition.\n\n3. **Counting the Edges**: A tetrahedron has 4 vertices and 6 edges. Each edge connects two vertices. Since each face has 3 edges, and there are 4 faces, we initially might think there are 4 * 3 = 12 edges. However, this count includes each edge twice (once for each face it is part of), so we must divide by 2 to get the actual number of distinct edges.\n\n4. **Calculating the Number of Distinct Edge Lengths**: \n   - Each face has 3 distinct edge lengths.\n   - There are 4 faces, so initially, we might think there are 4 * 3 = 12 distinct edge lengths.\n   - However, since each edge is shared by two faces, we must divide by 2 to avoid double-counting.\n\n5. **Final Calculation**:\n   - Total distinct edge lengths = (Number of faces * Number of edges per face) / 2\n   - Total distinct edge lengths = (4 * 3) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6\n\nTherefore, if each face of a tetrahedron is not an isosceles triangle, then it has at least $\\boxed{6}$ distinct edge lengths.",

This leaves 4 choices for $a_2$ (excluding $a_1$ and $a_1 \\pm 1$).\n\n3. **Third Digit (a_3):**\n   - Similarly, $a_3$ cannot be the same as $a_2$ and cannot be 1 unit away from $a_2$. This also leaves 4 choices for $a_3$.\n\n4. **Fourth Digit (a_4):**\n   - For $a_4$, it cannot be the same as $a_3$ and cannot be 1 unit away from $a_3$. This also leaves 4 choices for $a_4$.\n\n5. **Fifth Digit (a_5):**\n   - For $a_5$, it cannot be the same as $a_4$ and cannot be 1 unit away from $a_4$. This also leaves 4 choices for $a_5$.\n\n6. **Sixth Digit (a_6):**\n   - For $a_6$, it cannot be the same as $a_5$ and cannot be 1 unit away from $a_5$. This also leaves 4 choices for $a_6$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of such six-digit numbers can be calculated by multiplying the number of choices for each digit:\n\\[6 \\times 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 6 \\times 4^5\\]\n\nCalculating $4^5$:\n\\[4^5 = 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 1024\\]\n\nMultiplying by 6:\n\\[6 \\times 1024 = 6144\\]\n\nThus, the number of such six-digit numbers is $\\boxed{6144}$.",

The total number of ways to color the edges is the number of ways to choose 6 colors from 6, which is given by the combination formula $C(6, 6) = 6! / (6! - 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1) = 6! / (6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1) = 6$.\n\nHowever, not all of these colorings will result in all edges having different colors. We need to consider the constraints that edges sharing a vertex cannot have the same color. This means that for each vertex, the edges connected to it must be colored with different colors. Since a tetrahedron has 4 vertices, and each vertex is connected to 3 edges, we need to choose 3 colors from the 6 available colors for each vertex. The number of ways to do this is $C(6, 3) = 6! / (3! \\cdot (6-3)!) = 6! / (3! \\cdot 3!) = 20$.\n\nHowever, this calculation counts the cases where the edges connected to a vertex are colored with the same color as the edges connected to another vertex. To correct for this, we need to consider the cases where the edges connected to a vertex are colored with the same color as the edges connected to another vertex. This is a more complex calculation, but we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the correct number of ways to color the edges such that all edges have different colors.\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we find that the number of ways to color the edges such that all edges have different colors is $C(6, 6) - C(6, 3) + C(6, 2) - C(6, 1) + C(6, 0) = 6 - 20 + 15 - 6 + 1 = 16$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that all edges have different colors is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is $16 / 6 = \\boxed{\\frac{8}{3}}$.",

Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with a stack of 52 cards, all face-down.\n2. **First Operation**: Mim takes 7 cards from the top, flips them, and puts them back at the bottom. This means the top 7 cards are now face-up, and the bottom 45 cards remain face-down.\n3. **Subsequent Operations**: Each subsequent operation involves taking 7 cards from the top, flipping them, and putting them back at the bottom. This means the top 7 cards are always face-up, and the bottom 45 cards remain face-down.\n\nTo understand the process, let's analyze the effect of each operation on the number of face-up cards:\n\n- **After the first operation**: There are 7 face-up cards.\n- **After the second operation**: The top 7 cards are flipped, so there are now 14 face-up cards.\n- **After the third operation**: The top 7 cards are flipped again, so there are now 21 face-up cards.\n- **After the fourth operation**: The top 7 cards are flipped, so there are now 28 face-up cards.\n- **After the fifth operation**: The top 7 cards are flipped, so there are now 35 face-up cards.\n- **After the sixth operation**: The top 7 cards are flipped, so there are now 42 face-up cards.\n- **After the seventh operation**: The top 7 cards are flipped, so there are now 49 face-up cards.\n\nAt this point, we have 49 face-up cards, which is 1 less than the total number of cards (52).

This implies that $A$ and $B$ are complementary sets, meaning that together they cover all elements from $1$ to $20$.\n\n2. **Sum of Elements in $A$ and $B$**: Since $A$ and $B$ are complementary, the sum of the elements in $A$ and $B$ is equal to the sum of all elements from $1$ to $20$, which is:\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 20 = \\frac{20 \\times (20 + 1)}{2} = 210\n   \\]\n\n3. **Maximizing $M(A)$**: To maximize $M(A)$, we need to maximize the sum of the elements in $A$. Since $A$ and $B$ are complementary, maximizing $M(A)$ is equivalent to minimizing $M(B)$. \n\n4. **Minimizing $M(B)$**: To minimize $M(B)$, we should choose the smallest possible values for the elements in $B$. The smallest values in the set $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 20\\}$ are $1$ and $2$. However, since $2n + 2$ must be in $B$ for any $n \\in A$, we cannot choose $1$ for $B$ because $2n + 2$ would not be an integer for any $n$. Therefore, the smallest value we can choose for $B$ is $2$.\n\n5. **Choosing the Elements for $A$**: To minimize $M(B)$, we should choose the largest possible values for the elements in $A$. The largest values in the set $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 20\\}$ are $19$ and $20$. However, since $2n + 2$ must be in $B$ for any $n \\in A$, we cannot choose $20$ for $A$ because $2n + 2$ would not be an integer for any $n$. Therefore, the largest value we can choose for $A$ is $19$.\n\n6. **Calculating $M(A)$**: With $A = \\{19\\}$ and $B = \\{2, 4, 6, \\ldots, 20\\}$, we calculate $M(A)$ as follows:\n   \\[\n   M(A) = 19\n   \\]\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The maximum value of $M(A)$ is $19$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{19}$.",

This way, regardless of the value assigned by Bob, Alice will always have a product that is greater than Bob's product.\n   - For example, if Bob assigns a value to $x$, Alice can assign a value to $y$ such that the product of Cards 1 and 3 is greater than the product of Cards 2 and 4. Similarly, if Bob assigns a value to $y$, Alice can assign a value to $x$ to ensure the same outcome.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - By choosing Cards 1 and 3, and Cards 2 and 4, Alice can always ensure that her product is greater than Bob's, regardless of the values assigned by Bob.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Alice has a winning strategy, which can be encapsulated as $\\boxed{\\text{A}}$.",

Therefore, $c$ can be any digit from 1 to 9.\n\n2. **Determine the value of $a$:**\n\n   The equation implies that the product of $(\\overline{ab})^c$ and $\\overline{acd}$ results in $\\overline{abca cd}$. This means that the last digit of the product must be $d$, and the first digit of the product must be $a$. Since $a$ is the first digit of $\\overline{ab}$, it must be a non-zero digit. The only non-zero digit that can be the first digit of a number is 1.

The only digit that can be the last digit of a number is 1.

This is because $10^1 = 10$ and $10 \\times 101 = 1010$, which is a four-digit number. However, since the product must be a five-digit number, $c$ must be 2. Therefore, $c = 2$.\n\n6. **Verify the solution:**\n\n   With $a = 1$, $b = 0$, $c = 2$, and $d = 1$, the original equation becomes:\n\n   $$\n   (10)^2 \\times 101 = 10101\n   $$\n\n   This is indeed true, as $10^2 = 100$ and $100 \\times 101 = 10100$, which is a four-digit number. However, when we multiply $101$ by $101$, we get $10101$, which is a five-digit number, confirming our solution.\n\nTherefore, the values of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ that satisfy the given equation are $a = 1$, $b = 0$, $c = 2$, and $d = 1$.

This is because a polynomial of degree \\( n \\) has exactly \\( n \\) roots, including real and complex roots.\n\n2. **Analyze the leading coefficient:**\n   The leading coefficient of \\( f(x) \\) is 1, which is positive. This implies that as \\( x \\to \\infty \\), \\( f(x) \\to \\infty \\). Therefore, statement IV is true.\n\n3. **Check for imaginary roots:**\n   To determine if \\( f(x) \\) has imaginary roots, we can use the Rational Root Theorem, which states that any rational root of a polynomial \\( a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_1x + a_0 = 0 \\) must be a factor of the constant term \\( a_0 \\) divided by a factor of the leading coefficient \\( a_n \\).

We can also use synthetic division or the quadratic formula to check for real roots. After testing, we find that \\( x = -3 \\) is a root of \\( f(x) \\). Since the degree of the polynomial is 5, and we have found one real root, we can conclude that \\( f(x) \\) has at least one real root. However, without further analysis, we cannot determine the exact number of real roots, so we cannot confirm statement I.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   Based on the analysis, we have established that statement IV is true. Since we cannot confirm the exact number of real roots without further analysis, we cannot confirm statement I. Statement II is false because \\( f(x) \\) does not have any imaginary roots. Statement III is not directly addressed by our analysis, but since we cannot confirm the exact number of real roots, we cannot confirm it either.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]",

Let's denote the sides as a, b, and c, where c is the hypotenuse. According to the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\n\\[a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\]\n\nGiven the sides are 6, 7, and 9, we can check if this holds true:\n\n\\[6^2 + 7^2 = 36 + 49 = 85\\]\n\n\\[9^2 = 81\\]\n\nSince \\(85 \\neq 81\\), the Pythagorean theorem is not satisfied, which means the triangle is not a right triangle.\n\nNext, we check if the triangle is an acute triangle. An acute triangle is a triangle where all angles are less than 90 degrees. To determine this, we can use the cosine rule, which states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and the angle opposite side c being θ, the following holds:\n\n\\[\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}\\]\n\nFor our triangle, we have:\n\n\\[\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{6^2 + 7^2 - 9^2}{2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7}\\]\n\n\\[\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{36 + 49 - 81}{84}\\]\n\n\\[\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{4}{84}\\]\n\n\\[\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{21}\\]\n\nSince \\(\\frac{1}{21} > 0\\), and knowing that the cosine of an angle is positive in the first and fourth quadrants, we can conclude that the angle θ is in the first quadrant, which means it is acute.

This is a well-known formula, and the sum of the first n natural numbers is given by \\\\( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\\\). So, for n = 10, we have:\n\n\\\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{10} n = \\frac{10(10+1)}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 11}{2} = 55\n\\\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the sum of the sequence \\\\( 4n - 5 \\\\) from n = 1 to n = 10. This is a bit more complex, but we can still break it down into simpler parts. Notice that \\\\( 4n - 5 \\\\) can be rewritten as \\\\( 4(n - 1) + 1 \\\\), which is a sequence that starts at 1 and increases by 4 each time. The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by \\\\( \\frac{n}{2} (first \\ term + last \\ term) \\\\).

Therefore, we set the derivative equal to 2:\n   \\[\n   3e^{3x} = 2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for $x$**: To find $x$, we solve the equation for $e^{3x}$:\n   \\[\n   e^{3x} = \\frac{2}{3}\n   \\]\n   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   3x = \\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\n   \\]\n   Solving for $x$, we divide both sides by 3:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)}{3}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the value of $x$**: Using a calculator to evaluate the natural logarithm:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)}{3} \\approx \\frac{-0.405}{3} \\approx -0.135\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ where the slope of the tangent line to $f(x) = e^{3x} + 1$ is equal to 2 is approximately $-0.135$. \n\nHence, the correct answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",

However, we can use the definition of the limit to find the limit as $x$ approaches $0$:\n\n$$\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}-e}{x} = \\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}-e}{x}$$\n\nWe can rewrite the expression as:\n\n$$\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}-e}{x} = \\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}-e}{x} \\cdot \\frac{x}{x}$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}-e}{x} = \\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}-e}{x} \\cdot \\frac{x}{x} = \\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}-e}{x} \\cdot \\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{x}{x}$$\n\nSince $\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{x}{x} = 1$, we have:\n\n$$\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}-e}{x} = \\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}-e}{x} \\cdot 1 = \\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}-e}{x}$$\n\nNow, we can use the definition of the derivative to find the limit:\n\n$$\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}-e}{x} = f'(0) = \\frac{1}{0}\\left((1+0)^{\\frac{1}{0}}\\right) \\cdot \\ln(1+0)$$\n\nSince the expression is undefined, we cannot directly apply the definition of the derivative to find the limit. However, we can use the fact that the limit of a quotient is the quotient of the limits if both the numerator and the denominator approach zero or infinity. In this case, both the numerator and the denominator approach zero as $x$ approaches $0$, so we can use the definition of the derivative to find the limit.\n\nThe correct approach to find the limit is to use the definition of the derivative at $x = 0$:\n\n$$\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}-e}{x} = \\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}-e}{x} \\cdot \\frac{x}{x} = \\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}-e}{x} \\cdot \\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{x}{x} = \\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}-e}{x} \\cdot 1 = \\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}-e}{x}$$\n\nHowever, since the expression is undefined at $x = 0$, we cannot directly apply the definition of the derivative to find the limit. The correct approach is to use the definition of the limit as $x$ approaches $0$:\n\n$$\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}-e}{x} = \\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}-e}{x} \\cdot \\frac{x}{x} = \\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}-e}{x} \\cdot \\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{x}{x} = \\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}-e}{x} \\cdot 1 = \\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{(1+x)^{\\frac{1}{x}}-e}{x}$$\n\nThe correct answer is $\\boxed{1}$.",

The fifth pair has an undefined probability because it is impossible to draw a fifth pair after drawing the first four pairs.\n\nTherefore, the maximum probability of drawing a matching pair of socks is achieved when $n = 2$, which corresponds to the second pair.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$.",

      "question": "A pharmacy receives 2/5 of its flu vaccine shipments from Vendor A and the remainder of its shipments from Vendor B. Each shipment contains a very large number of vaccine vials. For Vendor A’s shipments, 3\\\\% of the vials are ineffective. For Vendor B, 8\\\\% of the vials are ineffective. The hospital tests 25 randomly selected vials from a shipment and finds that two vials are ineffective. What is the probability that this shipment came from Vendor A?",

      "generated_solution": "Let's denote the total number of vials in a shipment as V. According to the problem, the pharmacy receives 2/5 of its shipments from Vendor A and the remaining 3/5 from Vendor B. \n\nFor Vendor A, 3% of the vials are ineffective, so the number of ineffective vials from Vendor A is (3/100)V. For Vendor B, 8% of the vials are ineffective, so the number of ineffective vials from Vendor B is (8/100)V.\n\nThe total number of ineffective vials in a shipment is the sum of the ineffective vials from both vendors, which is (3/100)V + (8/100)V = (11/100)V.\n\nThe probability that a vial is ineffective is the ratio of the number of ineffective vials to the total number of vials, which is (11/100)V / V = 11/100.\n\nThe problem states that 25 randomly selected vials are tested and 2 are found to be ineffective. The probability of this happening is the binomial probability formula P(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where n is the number of trials, k is the number of successes, and p is the probability of success on a single trial.\n\nIn this case, n = 25, k = 2, and p = 11/100. The probability is:\n\nP(X = 2) = (25 choose 2) * (11/100)^2 * (89/100)^(25-2)\n\nFirst, calculate (25 choose 2):\n\n(25 choose 2) = 25! / (2! * (25-2)!) = 25! / (2! * 23!) = (25 * 24) / (2 * 1) = 25 * 12 = 300\n\nNow, calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 2) = 300 * (11/100)^2 * (89/100)^23\n\nP(X = 2) = 300 * (0.11)^2 * (0.89)^23\n\nP(X = 2) = 300 * 0.0121 *

The probability of exactly $k$ accidents in $n$ trials, where each trial has a probability $p$ of success (an accident happening) and a probability $q = 1-p$ of failure (no accident happening), is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k q^{n-k}\n   \\]\n   where $\\binom{n}{k}$ is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose $k$ successes from $n$ trials.\n\n   For our problem, $n = 5$ (the number of trials, which is the five-minute period), $k = 2$ (the number of accidents), and $p = 0.4$ (the probability of an accident happening in one minute).

In this case, we have a sample size of 300, so we can use the normal distribution to estimate the probability.\n\n1. **Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the sample mean:**\n   - The mean of the sample mean $\\bar{x}$ is the same as the mean of the original distribution, which is 195.\n   - The standard deviation of the sample mean is $\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}$, where $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the original distribution (16) and $n$ is the sample size (300).
