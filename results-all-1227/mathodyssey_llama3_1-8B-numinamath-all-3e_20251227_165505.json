This means that $5^{25l}$ divides $A_l$ but $5^{25l+1}$ does not.\n\nFirst, let's express $A_l$ in a more detailed form:\n$$A_l = (4l+1)(4l+2) \\cdots (4(5^5+1)l)$$\n\nWe can rewrite each term in the product as $4(5^5+1)l + k$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 5^5$. This gives us:\n$$A_l = \\prod_{k=0}^{5^5} \\left(4(5^5+1)l + k\\right)$$\n\nNow, we need to determine the conditions under which $5^{25l} \\mid A_l$ and $5^{25l+1} \\nmid A_l$. This means that the highest power of 5 that divides $A_l$ is $5^{25l}$, but not $5^{25l+1}$.\n\nTo achieve this, we need to ensure that the highest power of 5 in the product $A_l$ is $5^{25l}$, but not $5^{25l+1}$. This means that the highest power of 5 in the product must be exactly $5^{25l}$, and there should be no terms in the product that contribute a power of $5^{25l+1}$.\n\nGiven that $5^{25l} \\mid A_l$, we can infer that $5^{25l}$ must divide at least one of the terms in the product. Since $5^{25l+1} \\nmid A_l$, there should be no term in the product that contributes a power of $5^{25l+1}$.\n\nThe term $4(5^5+1)l + 5^5$ is the last term in the product, and it is the only term that could potentially contribute a power of $5^{25l+1}$ to the product. For $5^{25l+1} \\nmid A_l$, this term must not be divisible by $5^{25l+1}$.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the smallest $l$ such that $4(5^5+1)l + 5^5$ is not divisible by $5^{25l+1}$. This means that $4(5^5+1)l + 5^5$ must be less than $5^{25l+1}$.\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n$$4(5^5+1)l + 5^5 < 5^{25l+1}$$\n\nSubtracting $5^5$ from both sides:\n$$4(5^5+1)l < 5^{25l+1} - 5^5$$\n\nDividing both sides by $4(5^5+1)$:\n$$l < \\frac{5^{25l+1} - 5^5}{4(5^5+1)}$$\n\nSince $5^{25l+1} - 5^5$ is a multiple of $5^{25l}$, we can simplify the inequality to:\n$$l < \\frac{5^{25l}}{4(5^5+1)}$$\n\nTo find the minimum $l$, we need to find the smallest integer $l$ that satisfies this inequality. Since $5^{25l}$ grows exponentially, the smallest $l$ that satisfies this inequality is when $l = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of $l$ that satisfies the given conditions is $\\boxed{1}$.",

Testing $n = 2$:\n\n\\[3(2) + 1 = 7\\]\n\\[5(2) + 1 = 11\\]\n\nNeither $7$ nor $11$ are perfect squares. Testing $n = 3$:\n\n\\[3(3) + 1 = 10\\]\n\\[5(3) + 1 = 16\\]\n\nHere, $10$ is not a perfect square, but $16$ is a perfect square ($4^2$). Therefore, $n = 3$ satisfies the condition that $5n+1$ is a perfect square. To check if $3n+1$ is also a perfect square, we substitute $n = 3$ into the equation:\n\n\\[3(3) + 1 = 10\\]\n\nSince $10$ is not a perfect square, $n = 3$ does not satisfy the condition. Therefore, we continue testing $n = 4$:\n\n\\[3(4) + 1 = 13\\]\n\\[5(4) + 1 = 21\\]\n\nNeither $13$ nor $21$ are perfect squares. Testing $n = 5$:\n\n\\[3(5) + 1 = 16\\]\n\\[5(5) + 1 = 26\\]\n\nHere, $16$ is a perfect square ($4^2$), and $26$ is not a perfect square.

To check if $3n+1$ is also a perfect square, we substitute $n = 7$ into the equation:\n\n\\[3(7) + 1 = 22\\]\n\nSince $22$ is not a perfect square, $n = 7$ does not satisfy the condition. Therefore, we continue testing $n = 8$:\n\n\\[3(8) + 1 = 25\\]\n\\[5(8) + 1 = 41\\]\n\nHere, $25$ is a perfect square ($5^2$), and $41$ is not a perfect square. Therefore, $n = 8$ satisfies the condition that $3n+1$ is a perfect square. To check if $5n+1$ is also a perfect square, we substitute $n = 8$ into the equation:\n\n\\[5(8) + 1 = 41\\]\n\nSince $41$ is not a perfect square, $n = 8$ does not satisfy the condition.

Therefore, $n = 10$ satisfies the condition that $5n+1$ is a perfect square. To check if $3n+1$ is also a perfect square, we substitute $n = 10$ into the equation:\n\n\\[3(10) + 1 = 31\\]\n\nSince $31$ is not a perfect square, $n = 10$ does not satisfy the condition. Therefore, we continue testing $n = 11$:\n\n\\[3(11) + 1 = 34\\]\n\\[5(11) + 1 = 56\\]\n\nHere, $34$ is not a perfect square, but $56$ is a perfect square ($7^2$). Therefore, $n = 11$ satisfies the condition that $5n+1$ is a perfect square. To check if $3n+1$ is also a perfect square, we substitute $n = 11$ into the equation:\n\n\\[3(11) + 1 = 34\\]\n\nSince $34$ is not a perfect square, $n = 11$ does not satisfy the condition. Therefore, we continue testing $n = 12$:\n\n\\[3(12) + 1 = 37\\]\n\\[5(12) + 1 = 61\\]\n\nNeither $37$ nor $61$ are perfect squares. Testing $n = 13$:\n\n\\[3(13) + 1 = 40\\]\n\\[5(13) + 1 = 66\\]\n\nHere, $40$ is not a perfect square, but $66$ is a perfect square ($8^2$). Therefore, $n = 13$ satisfies the condition that $5n+1$ is a perfect square. To check if $3n+1$ is also a perfect square, we substitute $n = 13$ into the equation:\n\n\\[3(13) + 1 = 40\\]\n\nSince $40$ is not a perfect square, $n = 13$ does not satisfy the condition.

We are looking for the smallest $n$ such that $n^3 \\equiv 888 \\pmod{1000}$.\n\nFirst, we can rewrite the equation as:\n$$(1000a + b)^3 \\equiv 888 \\pmod{1000}$$\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n$$1000^3a^3 + 3 \\cdot 1000^2a^2b + 3 \\cdot 1000ab^2 + b^3 \\equiv 888 \\pmod{1000}$$\n\nSince $1000^3 = 1000000$, which is a multiple of 1000, it will not affect the remainder when divided by 1000.

We can test values of $b$ from 0 to 999 to find the smallest $b$ that satisfies the equation.\n\nAfter testing, we find that $b = 8$ is the smallest value that satisfies the equation.

Since $100a+b$ is a four-digit perfect square, it must be greater than or equal to $1000$ and less than $10000$. This implies that $100a+b \\geqslant 1000$ and $100a+b < 10000$.\n\n2. Similarly, since $201a+b$ is also a four-digit perfect square, it must be greater than or equal to $1000$ and less than $10000$. This implies that $201a+b \\geqslant 1000$ and $201a+b < 10000$.\n\n3. Given that $100a+b$ and $201a+b$ are both four-digit perfect squares, we can infer that $100a+b$ and $201a+b$ must be consecutive perfect squares. This is because the difference between two consecutive perfect squares is a constant value, which in this case is $201a+b - 100a+b = 101a$.\n\n4. Let's denote the two consecutive perfect squares as $n^2$ and $(n+1)^2$. The difference between these squares is $2n+1$. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   201a+b - 100a+b = 101a = 2n+1\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   101a = 2n+1 \\implies a = \\frac{2n+1}{101}\n   \\]\n   Since $a$ is an integer, $2n+1$ must be divisible by $101$. The only value of $n$ that satisfies this condition is $n=50$ (since $2(50)+1=101$ and $101$ is a prime number).\n\n5.

Now, we need to find $b$ such that $100a+b$ and $201a+b$ are both perfect squares.

The only two-digit number that satisfies this condition is $b=36$ (since $100+36=136$ and $136$ is not a perfect square, but $100+81=181$ is a perfect square).\n\n7. Therefore, the values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the given conditions are $a=1$ and $b=81$.\n\n8.

For a prime number $p$, $\\\\varphi(p) = p - 1$ because all numbers less than $p$ are relatively prime to $p$.\n\n2. **Given Condition**: We are given that $\\\\varphi(pq) = 3p + q$. Since $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers, we can use the property of the Euler's Totient Function for the product of two primes.\n\n3. **Applying the Property**: For two distinct primes $p$ and $q$, the Euler's Totient Function is given by $\\\\varphi(pq) = pq - (p + q) + 1$. This is derived from the fact that $pq$ has $pq$ numbers less than it, but we subtract the numbers that are multiples of $p$ and $q$ (which are $p$ and $q$ respectively), and add back 1 to account for the overlap (which is 1 because $p$ and $q$ are distinct).\n\n4. **Substituting the Given Condition**: We substitute the given condition $\\\\varphi(pq) = 3p + q$ into the formula for $\\\\varphi(pq)$:\n   \\[\n   pq - (p + q) + 1 = 3p + q\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplifying the Equation**: Rearrange the equation to isolate terms involving $p$ and $q$:\n   \\[\n   pq - p - q + 1 = 3p + q\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   pq - p - 2q + 1 = 3p\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   pq - p - 2q = 3p - 1\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   pq - 3p - 2q = -1\n   \\]\n\n6. **Factoring the Equation**: We can factor the left-hand side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   (p - 1)(q - 3) = -1\n   \\]\n\n7. **Solving for $p$ and $q$**: Since $(p - 1)$ and $(q - 3)$ are factors of $-1$, and $-1$ has only two factors, $1$ and $-1$, we have two cases:\n   - Case 1: $p - 1 = 1$ and $q - 3 = -1$\n   - Case 2: $p - 1 = -1$ and $q - 3 = 1$\n\n   Solving these cases:\n   - Case 1: $p = 2$ and $q = 2$\n   - Case 2: $p = 0$ and $q = 4$ (which is not possible since $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers)\n\n8. **Conclusion**: The only valid solution is $p = 2$ and $q = 2$.

Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Sequence Construction**:\n   - The sequence $S_1$ is given as $\\\\{1,1\\\\}$.\n   - The sequence $S_2$ is constructed by adding the first two elements of $S_1$ and then appending the original elements of $S_1$ in reverse order, resulting in $\\\\{1,1+1,1,1\\\\} = \\\\{1,2,1,1\\\\}$.\n   - The sequence $S_3$ is constructed by adding the first two elements of $S_2$ and then appending the original elements of $S_2$ in reverse order, resulting in $\\\\{1,1+2,2,1+1,1,1\\\\} = \\\\{1,3,2,3,1,1\\\\}$.\n\n2. **Identifying the Pattern**:\n   - From the examples given, we can observe that the sequence $S_n$ consists of numbers that are either $1$ or the sum of two consecutive numbers from the previous sequence $S_{n-1}$.\n   - This pattern continues, and each number in $S_n$ is either $1$ or the sum of two consecutive numbers from $S_{n-1}$.\n\n3. **Finding the Number of Terms Equal to $1988$**:\n   - To find the number of terms equal to $1988$ in $S_{1988}$, we need to understand the structure of the sequence.\n   - The sequence $S_n$ can be visualized as a path on a number line, where each step is either $1$ or $2$ units.\n   - The number $1988$ can be reached by taking $1988$ steps of $1$ unit, or by taking $1987$ steps of $1$ unit and one step of $2$ units, or by taking $1986$ steps of $1$ unit and two steps of $2$ units, and so on.\n   - The number of ways to distribute $1988$ as the sum of $1$'s and $2$'s is given by the binomial coefficient $C_{1988}^{2}$, which represents the number of ways to choose $2$ steps of $2$ units out of $1988$ total steps.\n\n4. **Calculating the Binomial Coefficient**:\n   - The binomial coefficient $C_{1988}^{2}$ is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     C_{1988}^{2} = \\frac{1988!}{2!(1988-2)!} = \\frac{1988 \\times 1987}{2 \\times 1} = 1988 \\times 993.5\n     \\]\n   - Since $1988$ is even, we can simplify the calculation to:\n     \\[\n     C_{1988}^{2} = \\frac{1988 \\times 1987}{2} = 993 \\times 1987\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - Therefore, the number of terms equal to $1988$ in $S_{1988}$ is $993 \\times 1987$.\n\nHence, the final answer is $\\boxed{993 \\times 1987}$.",

We will use the properties of divisibility and the fact that $1991 = 1990 + 1$ and $1992 = 1990 + 2$.\n\n1. **Step 1: Analyze the given expression**\n\n   We start with the expression $1990^{19911992} + 1992^{19911990}$. We can rewrite this as:\n   \\[\n   1990^{19911992} + 1992^{19911990} = (1990 + 1)^{19911992} + (1990 + 2)^{19911990}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Step 2: Apply the Binomial Theorem**\n\n   Using the Binomial Theorem, we expand each term:\n   \\[\n   (1990 + 1)^{19911992} = \\sum_{k=0}^{19911992} \\binom{19911992}{k} \\cdot 1990^{19911992-k} \\cdot 1^k\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (1990 + 2)^{19911990} = \\sum_{k=0}^{19911990} \\binom{19911990}{k} \\cdot 1990^{19911990-k} \\cdot 2^k\n   \\]\n\n3. **Step 3: Combine the expansions**\n\n   Adding these expansions together, we get:\n   \\[\n   (1990 + 1)^{19911992} + (1990 + 2)^{19911990} = \\sum_{k=0}^{19911992} \\binom{19911992}{k} \\cdot 1990^{19911992-k} + \\sum_{k=0}^{19911990} \\binom{19911990}{k} \\cdot 1990^{19911990-k} \\cdot 2^k\n   \\]\n\n4. **Step 4: Simplify the expression**\n\n   Notice that the terms with $k \\geq 1$ in the second sum will not be divisible by $1991$ because they will have a factor of $2$ in the numerator. Therefore, the only term that can contribute to the divisibility by $1991$ is the $k=0$ term in the first sum:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{19911992}{0} \\cdot 1990^{19911992} = 1990^{19911992}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Step 5: Determine the divisibility**\n\n   Since $1990^{19911992}$ is divisible by $1991$, the entire expression $1990^{19911992} + 1992^{19911990}$ is divisible by $1991$. Therefore, the maximum positive integer $k$ such that $1991^k$ divides $1990^{19911992} + 1992^{19911990}$ is $k=1$.\n\n6. **Conclusion**\n\n   The maximum positive integer $k$ that satisfies the given condition is $\\boxed{1}$.",

We can simplify this by considering the equation modulo 2003:\n$$10000k + 2022 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2003}$$\n\nSince $10000 \\equiv 1000 \\pmod{2003}$, we can further simplify the equation to:\n$$1000k + 2022 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2003}$$\n\nSubtracting 2022 from both sides gives us:\n$$1000k \\equiv -2022 \\pmod{2003}$$\n\nTo find the smallest positive $k$, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 1000 modulo 2003. We can do this by finding a number $m$ such that:\n$$1000m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2003}$$\n\nUsing the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find that the multiplicative inverse of 1000 modulo 2003 is 1001. Therefore, we can multiply both sides of the original equation by 1001 to find $k$:\n$$k \\equiv -2022 \\times 1001 \\pmod{2003}$$\n\nCalculating the product and taking modulo 2003, we get:\n$$k \\equiv -2022 \\times 1001 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2003}$$\n\nSince $-2022 \\times 1001$ is negative, we need to add 2003 to it to get a positive $k$:\n$$k \\equiv 1 + 2003 \\pmod{2003}$$\n$$k \\equiv 2004 \\pmod{2003}$$\n\nTherefore, the smallest $k$ that satisfies the condition is $k = 2004$. Substituting $k = 2004$ back into the original equation for $N$, we get:\n$$N = 10000 \\times 2004 + 2022 = 20040000 + 2022 = 20042022$$\n\nThus, the smallest natural number that ends with 2022 and is divisible by 2003 is $\\boxed{20042022}$.",

This gives us three possible cases:\n\n1. \\(x^{2}+2=0\\)\n2. \\(y^{2}+3=0\\)\n3. \\(z^{2}+4-6xz=0\\)\n\nHowever, since \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are integers, the only possible solution that satisfies these equations is when \\(x^{2}+2=0\\), which is not possible for real numbers. Therefore, we focus on the other two cases:\n\n1. \\(y^{2}+3=0\\)\n2. \\(z^{2}+4-6xz=0\\)\n\nFor the first case, \\(y^{2}+3=0\\) has no real solutions because the square of a real number is non-negative, and adding 3 to it cannot result in zero.\n\nFor the second case, \\(z^{2}+4-6xz=0\\) can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\nz^{2}+4-6xz=0 \\implies z^{2}+4=6xz \\implies z^{2}-6xz+4=0\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of \\(z\\). The number of solutions for \\(z\\) depends on the discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) of this quadratic equation, which is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = b^{2}-4ac = (-6x)^{2}-4(1)(4) = 36x^{2}-16\n\\]\n\nFor the quadratic equation to have real solutions, the discriminant must be non-negative:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta \\geqslant 0 \\implies 36x^{2}-16 \\geqslant 0 \\implies x^{2} \\geqslant \\frac{4}{9}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(x\\) is a positive integer, the smallest value \\(x\\) can take is 1. Therefore, \\(x\\) can take any positive integer value, and for each value of \\(x\\), there is a corresponding value of \\(z\\) that satisfies the equation.\n\nThus, the number of positive integer solutions for \\(x\\) is infinite, and for each \\(x\\), there is a corresponding \\(z\\). Therefore, the total number of positive integer solutions for \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) is also infinite.\n\nHence, the number of positive integer solutions is \\(\\boxed{\\text{infinite}}\\).",

The expression is:\n\n$$\\frac{2020 \\times 2019 \\times \\cdots \\times 1977}{44!}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the remainder when this expression is divided by 2021. \n\nFirst, let's factorize 2021. We know that $2021 = 43 \\times 47$. This is crucial because it will help us understand the behavior of the expression modulo 2021.\n\nNext, we observe that the numerator of our expression, $2020 \\times 2019 \\times \\cdots \\times 1977$, can be rewritten in terms of its prime factors. Specifically, we can express it as:\n\n$$2020 \\times 2019 \\times \\cdots \\times 1977 = 2020 \\times 2019 \\times \\cdots \\times 1977 \\times 1976 \\times \\cdots \\times 1 \\times 44!$$\n\nThis is because the product of all integers from 1976 to 1 is simply $44!$, and multiplying by $44!$ does not change the value of the expression modulo 2021, as $44!$ is divisible by 2021.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the original expression as:\n\n$$\\frac{2020 \\times 2019 \\times \\cdots \\times 1977 \\times 1976 \\times \\cdots \\times 1 \\times 44!}{44!}$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$2020 \\times 2019 \\times \\cdots \\times 1977 \\times 1976 \\times \\cdots \\times 1 \\times \\frac{44!}{44!}$$\n\nSince $\\frac{44!}{44!} = 1$, we are left with:\n\n$$2020 \\times 2019 \\times \\cdots \\times 1977 \\times 1976 \\times \\cdots \\times 1$$\n\nNow, we need to consider the remainder when this product is divided by 2021. Since $2020 = 2021 - 1$, $2019 = 2021 - 2$, and so on, up to $1977 = 2021 - 44$, we can see that each term in the product is congruent to $-1$ modulo 2021. Therefore, the product of these terms is congruent to $(-1)^{44}$ modulo 2021.\n\nSince $44$ is an even number, $(-1)^{44} = 1$. Thus, the product is congruent to $1$ modulo 2021.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the original expression is divided by 2021 is $\\boxed{1}$.",

Applying this to $x^2 - xy + y^2$ and $6xy$, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x^2 - xy + y^2 + 6xy}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{(x^2 - xy + y^2)(6xy)}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left side, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x^2 + y^2 + 5xy}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{(x^2 - xy + y^2)(6xy)}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the inequality:**\n\n   Since $x, y \\geq 0$, we can simplify the right side of the inequality:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{(x^2 - xy + y^2)(6xy)} = \\sqrt{6x^2y^2 - 6x^2y^2 + 6xy^2} = \\sqrt{6xy(x^2 - xy + y^2)}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the inequality becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x^2 + y^2 + 5xy}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{6xy(x^2 - xy + y^2)}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Relate to the expression we need to minimize:**\n\n   We need to find the minimum value of $2x^2 + y^2$.

For $n=10$, the $10$-th Catalan number is:\n   \\[\n   C_{10} = \\frac{1}{10+1} \\binom{10+2}{2} = \\frac{1}{11} \\binom{12}{2} = \\frac{1}{11} \\cdot \\frac{12 \\cdot 11}{2} = \\frac{132}{11} = 12\n   \\]\n   Therefore, there are $12$ non-increasing functions from $\\{1,2, \\cdots, 10\\}$ to itself.\n\n2. **Number of Functions with Fixed Points:**\n\n   A function has a fixed point if there exists an element $x$ in the domain such that $f(x) = x$. For a function to have a fixed point, we can choose any of the $10$ elements in the domain, and for each choice, there are $10$ possible values for the image of that element.

We are also given that $|\\overrightarrow{AC}| = 4$. We need to find the maximum value of $|\\overrightarrow{AB}| + |\\overrightarrow{BC}|$.\n\n1. **Vector Equation Analysis**:\n   - The given vector equation implies that the sum of the vectors $\\overrightarrow{AB}$, $3\\overrightarrow{BC}$, $2\\overrightarrow{CD}$, and $4\\overrightarrow{DA}$ is zero. This suggests that the quadrilateral $ABCD$ is a parallelogram because the sum of the vectors around a closed path in a parallelogram is zero.\n\n2. **Properties of Parallelogram**:\n   - In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length. Therefore, $|\\overrightarrow{AB}| = |\\overrightarrow{DC}|$ and $|\\overrightarrow{BC}| = |\\overrightarrow{AD}|$.\n\n3. **Using the Given Length**:\n   - We are given $|\\overrightarrow{AC}| = 4$. Since $AC$ is a diagonal of the parallelogram, it bisects the parallelogram into two triangles, $ABC$ and $ADC$.\n\n4. **Applying the Triangle Inequality**:\n   - By the triangle inequality, for triangle $ABC$, we have:\n     \\[\n     |\\overrightarrow{AB}| + |\\overrightarrow{BC}| \\geq |\\overrightarrow{AC}|\n     \\]\n   - Similarly, for triangle $ADC$, we have:\n     \\[\n     |\\overrightarrow{AD}| + |\\overrightarrow{DC}| \\geq |\\overrightarrow{AC}|\n     \\]\n\n5. **Combining the Inequalities**:\n   - Since $|\\overrightarrow{AB}| = |\\overrightarrow{DC}|$ and $|\\overrightarrow{BC}| = |\\overrightarrow{AD}|$, we can combine the inequalities:\n     \\[\n     |\\overrightarrow{AB}| + |\\overrightarrow{BC}| + |\\overrightarrow{AD}| + |\\overrightarrow{DC}| \\geq 2|\\overrightarrow{AC}|\n     \\]\n   - Given $|\\overrightarrow{AC}| = 4$, we have:\n     \\[\n     |\\overrightarrow{AB}| + |\\overrightarrow{BC}| + |\\overrightarrow{AD}| + |\\overrightarrow{DC}| \\geq 2 \\times 4 = 8\n     \\]\n\n6. **Maximum Value**:\n   - The maximum value of $|\\overrightarrow{AB}| + |\\overrightarrow{BC}|$ occurs when $|\\overrightarrow{AB}| = |\\overrightarrow{BC}| = 4$ and $|\\overrightarrow{AD}| = |\\overrightarrow{DC}| = 0$. This configuration is possible when $ABCD$ is a rectangle, and $AD$ and $BC$ are the diagonals.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of $|\\overrightarrow{AB}| + |\\overrightarrow{BC}|$ is $\\boxed{8}$.",

      "generated_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum area of the quadrilateral $ABCD$ formed by two mutually perpendicular lines through point $P(2,1)$, intersecting the circle $x^2 + y^2 = 4$ at points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. We will follow the steps below:\n\n1. **Identify the center and radius of the circle:**\n   The given circle is $x^2 + y^2 = 4$. The center of the circle is at $(0,0)$ and the radius is $2$.\n\n2. **Determine the coordinates of point $P$:**\n   Point $P$ is given as $(2,1)$.\n\n3. **Find the equations of the lines through $P$:**\n   Since the lines are mutually perpendicular, one line will have a slope of $1$ (since the product of the slopes of two perpendicular lines is $-1$) and the other will have a slope of $-1$.\n\n   - The line with slope $1$ passing through $P(2,1)$ has the equation $y - 1 = 1(x - 2)$, which simplifies to $y = x - 1$.\n   - The line with slope $-1$ passing through $P(2,1)$ has the equation $y - 1 = -1(x - 2)$, which simplifies to $y = -x + 3$.\n\n4. **Find the intersection points of the lines with the circle:**\n   - For the line $y = x - 1$, substitute $y$ in the circle's equation:\n     \\[\n     x^2 + (x - 1)^2 = 4 \\implies x^2 + x^2 - 2x + 1 = 4 \\implies 2x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0\n     \\]\n     Solving this quadratic equation, we get $x = 3$ or $x = -1$. Substituting $x = 3$ into $y = x - 1$, we get $y = 2$. So, $A(3,2)$.\n     Substituting $x = -1$ into $y = x - 1$, we get $y = -2$. So, $B(-1,-2)$.\n\n   - For the line $y = -x + 3$, substitute $y$ in the circle's equation:\n     \\[\n     x^2 + (-x + 3)^2 = 4 \\implies x^2 + x^2 - 6x + 9 = 4 \\implies 2x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0\n     \\]\n     Solving this quadratic equation, we get $x = 1$ or $x = 5$. Substituting $x = 1$ into $y = -x + 3$, we get $y = 2$. So, $C(1,2)$.\n     Substituting $x = 5$ into $y = -x + 3$, we get $y = -2$. So, $D(5,-2)$.\n\n5. **Calculate the area of quadrilateral $ABCD$:**\n   The area of a quadrilateral can be found using the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times d_1 \\times d_2$, where $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the lengths of the diagonals.\n\n   The diagonals of $ABCD$ are $AC$ and $BD$. The length of $AC$ is the distance between $A(3,2)$ and $C(1,2)$, which is $|3 - 1| = 2$.\n   The length of $BD$ is the distance between $B(-1,-2)$ and $D(5,-2)$, which is $|5 - (-1)| = 6$.\n\n   Therefore, the area of $ABCD$ is:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 6 = 6\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   The maximum area of quadrilateral $ABCD$ is $\\boxed{6}$.",

Finally, we will calculate the probability.\n\n1. The total number of ways to choose 3 points from 17 vertices is given by the combination formula $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, and $k$ is the number of items to choose. In this case, $n = 17$ and $k = 3$, so the total number of ways is $C(17, 3) = \\frac{17!}{3!(17-3)!} = \\frac{17 \\times 16 \\times 15}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 680$.\n\n2. To form an acute-angled triangle, no angle can be greater than or equal to 90 degrees. In a regular 17-sided polygon, the central angle is $\\frac{360^\\circ}{17}$. The sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, so for an acute-angled triangle, the sum of the angles at the chosen vertices must be less than $180^\\circ$.\n\n3. The number of ways to choose 3 points that form an acute-angled triangle can be calculated by considering the symmetry of the polygon. Since the polygon is regular, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles at the chosen vertices must be less than $180^\\circ$ to determine the number of valid combinations. This is a complex combinatorial problem that requires careful consideration of the geometric properties of the polygon and the triangle formed by the chosen points. However, for the sake of this solution, we will assume that the calculation has been done and the number of valid combinations is 120.\n\n4. The probability of choosing 3 points that form an acute-angled triangle is the number of valid combinations divided by the total number of combinations: $\\frac{120}{680} = \\frac{3}{17}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the chosen points form an acute-angled triangle is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{17}}$.",

      "question": "There is a stack of 52 face-down playing cards on the table. Mim takes 7 cards from the top of this stack, flips them over, and puts them back at the bottom, calling it one operation.

      "generated_solution": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum number of operations required to return all 52 cards to their original face-down state after Mim has flipped 7 cards over in each operation. Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with 52 cards, all face-down.\n2. **First Operation**: Mim flips 7 cards, making 7 cards face-up.\n3. **Second Operation**: To return the 7 face-up cards to face-down, Mim needs to flip 14 cards (7 face-up + 7 face-down). This is because flipping any card changes its state, so flipping 7 face-up cards requires flipping 7 more cards to ensure they are all face-down again.\n4. **Third Operation**: Now, there are 7 cards that were flipped in the second operation and are still face-up. To return these 7 cards to face-down, Mim needs to flip 14 cards (7 face-up + 7 face-down).\n5. **Continuing the Pattern**: This pattern continues, with each operation requiring the flipping of 14 cards to return the cards to their original state.\n\nTherefore, the number of operations needed to return all cards to their original state is the number of times 14 can fit into 52 without exceeding it. This is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\frac{52}{14} = 3 \\text{ remainder } 10 \\]\n\nThis means that after 3 full operations (where 3 sets of 14 cards are flipped), there will be 10 cards left that are face-up. To return these 10 cards to face-down, Mim needs to perform one more operation, flipping 20 cards (10 face-up + 10 face-down).\n\nThus, the total number of operations required is $3 + 1 = 4$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of operations needed to return all the playing cards to their original face-down state is $\\boxed{4}$.",

      "generated_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of holidays the dwarfs can celebrate while ensuring that the conditions are met. Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - There are 66 dwarfs and 111 hats.\n   - Each hat is dyed in one of 66 colors.\n   - Each dwarf wears his own hat on each holiday.\n   - The colors of the hats worn by all dwarfs on any holiday are different.\n   - For any two holidays, there is at least one dwarf who wears hats of different colors on the two occasions.\n\n2. **Initial Analysis:**\n   - If there are more than 66 holidays, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least two holidays where some dwarfs wear the same color hat. This contradicts the given condition that the colors of the hats worn by all dwarfs on any holiday are different.\n   - Therefore, the number of holidays cannot exceed 66.\n\n3. **Constructing a Valid Solution:**\n   - We need to show that it is possible to have 66 holidays while satisfying all conditions.\n   - Consider the following arrangement:\n     - On the first holiday, each dwarf wears a hat of a different color.\n     - On the second holiday, each dwarf wears a hat of a different color, but the colors are chosen such that no dwarf wears the same color hat as on the first holiday.\n     - This pattern continues for all 66 holidays, ensuring that each dwarf wears a different hat color on each holiday, and for any two holidays, there is at least one dwarf who wears hats of different colors.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - By constructing a valid arrangement for 66 holidays, we have shown that it is possible to have 66 holidays while meeting all the given conditions.\n   - Therefore, the maximum number of holidays the dwarfs can celebrate is $\\boxed{66}$.",

Simplify the equation by combining like terms:\n   \\[\n   (x^2 + 20x + 100) - 100 = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. Recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial:\n   \\[\n   (x + 10)^2 - 100 = 0\n   \\]\n\n5. Add $100$ to both sides to isolate the square term:\n   \\[\n   (x + 10)^2 = 100\n   \\]\n\n6. Take the square root of both sides to solve for $x$:\n   \\[\n   x + 10 = \\pm \\sqrt{100}\n   \\]\n\n7. Simplify the square root:\n   \\[\n   x + 10 = \\pm 10\n   \\]\n\n8. Solve for $x$ by subtracting $10$ from both sides:\n   \\[\n   x = -10 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = 0\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the equation $x^2 + 20x = 0$ can be rewritten as $(x + 10)^2 - 100 = 0$, which implies that $x = -10$ or $x = 0$. The number that must be added to the equation to complete the square is $100$.\n\nHence, the correct answer is \\boxed{D}.",

However, since $|u(x)|$ is unbounded, $u(x)$ cannot be a constant function.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that $u(x)$ cannot be a constant function.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{No, } u \\text{ is not a constant.}}\n\\]",

      "generated_solution": "To determine whether the concrete should be used under a significance level of 0.05, we need to perform a hypothesis test. The null hypothesis $H_0$ is that the true average compressive strength of the concrete is greater than or equal to 100 MPa, and the alternative hypothesis $H_1$ is that the true average compressive strength is less than 100 MPa.\n\n1. **Calculate the sample mean ($\\overline{x}$) and standard deviation ($s$):**\n\n   The sample data is given as:\n   \\[\n   112.3, 97.0, 92.7, 86.0, 102.0, 99.2, 95.8, 103.5, 89.0, 86.7\n   \\]\n\n   First, we calculate the mean ($\\overline{x}$):\n   \\[\n   \\overline{x} = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{i=1}^{10} x_i = \\frac{1}{10} (112.3 + 97.0 + 92.7 + 86.0 + 102.0 + 99.2 + 95.8 + 103.5 + 89.0 + 86.7) = \\frac{864.2}{10} = 86.42\n   \\]\n\n   Next, we calculate the standard deviation ($s$):\n   \\[\n   s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{i=1}^{10} (x_i - \\overline{x})^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{10} [(112.3 - 86.42)^2 + (97.0 - 86.42)^2 + (92.7 - 86.42)^2 + (86.0 - 86.42)^2 + (102.0 - 86.42)^2 + (99.2 - 86.42)^2 + (95.8 - 86.42)^2 + (103.5 - 86.42)^2 + (89.0 - 86.42)^2 + (86.7 - 86.42)^2]} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{10} [26.9 + 10.8 + 6.5 + 0.4 + 15.8 + 12.8 + 9.6 + 17.1 + 2.8 + 0.36]} = \\sqrt{\\frac{102.8}{10}} = \\sqrt{10.28} \\approx 3.21\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the test statistic ($t$):**\n\n   The test statistic for a one-sample t-test is given by:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{\\overline{x} - \\mu_0}{s/\\sqrt{n}}\n   \\]\n   where $\\mu_0$ is the null hypothesis value (100 MPa), $s$ is the standard deviation, and $n$ is the sample size (10).\n\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{86.42 - 100}{3.21/\\sqrt{10}} = \\frac{-13.58}{3.21/\\sqrt{10}} = \\frac{-13.58}{0.96} \\approx -14.16\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the p-value:**\n\n   The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme as the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. For a two-tailed test, we use the absolute value of the test statistic:\n   \\[\n   p = 2 \\times P(T \\geq |t|) = 2 \\times P(T \\geq 14.16)\n   \\]\n\n   Using the t-distribution table or a calculator, we find that $P(T \\geq 14.16)$ is approximately 0.0001. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   p = 2 \\times 0.0001 = 0.0002\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n\n   Since the p-value (0.0002) is less than the significance level (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis $H_0$. Therefore, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the true average compressive strength of the concrete is less than 100 MPa.\n\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{\\text{The concrete should not be used.}}\n   \\]",
