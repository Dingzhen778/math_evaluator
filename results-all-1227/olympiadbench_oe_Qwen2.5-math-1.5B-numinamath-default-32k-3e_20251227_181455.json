This will give us a system of 7 equations with 4 unknowns (\\( w, d, a, \\) and \\( b \\))).\n\nTo solve this system of equations, we can use various methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix methods. However, since we are given the final standings, we can use this information to simplify our calculations.\n\nFor example, we can use the fact that the total number of matches played by each team is 17. This means that the sum of wins, losses, and draws for each team must be 17.\n\nUsing this information, we can set up additional equations to help us solve for \\( w, d, a, \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nOnce we have set up our system of equations, we can use various methods to solve for the unknowns. This may involve using algebraic manipulation, substitution, or matrix methods.\n\nAfter solving the system of equations, we will obtain the values of \\( w, d, a, \\) and \\( b \\). These values will give us the points awarded for each win, draw, bonus bowling point, and bonus batting point.\n\nFinally, we can box our final answer in the format requested:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{w, d, a, b}\n\\]",

We can start by considering the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 64, which is $2^6 = 64$. \n\nIf we use $2^6$ as one of the parts in the partition, then the remaining part must be 1, since $64 = 2^6 \\times 1$. \n\nTherefore, one of the multiplicative partitions of 64 is $2^6 \\times 1$. \n\nHowever, we can also consider partitions that consist of multiple powers of 2.

For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.",

We need to find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length \\( k \\) in this town.\n\n### Step 2: Defining the Problem in Terms of Graph Theory\nWe can model the problem using graph theory.

Specifically, we can use the concept of permutations and combinations to count the number of ways to arrange the residents in a cycle.\n\n### Step 5: Applying the Formula\nThe number of distinguishable resident cycles of length \\( k \\) in \\(\\mathcal{F}_{d}}\\) can be given by the following formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of distinguishable cycles} = \\frac{(d-1)!)}{(d-k-1)!)}\n\\]\n\nThis formula takes into account the number of dishes \\( d \\), the length of the cycle \\( k \\), and the fact that each resident knows how to make exactly two dishes.\n\n### Step 6: Final Answer\nThe final answer, in the boxed format, is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{(d-1)!)}{(d-k-1)!)}}}\n\\]",

For each choice, there are 3 ways to choose which two faces will be the other color. Therefore, there are:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 3 = 6\n     \\]\n     such colorings.\n\n   - **Case 3: Three faces are one color, and three faces are the other color.**\n     There are 2 ways to choose which color will be on the three faces.

When $N$ is doubled, it should become a $(k+1)$-digit number. This implies:\n   \\[\n   2N \\geq 10^k\n   \\]\n   Since $N$ is a $k$-digit number, we have:\n   \\[\n   10^{k-1}} \\leq N < 10^k\n   \\]\n\n3. **Finding the Range of $N$:**\n   From the inequality $2N \\geq 10^k$, we get:\n   \\[\n   N \\geq \\frac{10^k}{2}} = 5 \\cdot 10^{k-2}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the range of $N$ is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\cdot 10^{k-2} \\leq N < 10^k\n   \\]\n\n4. **Counting the Number of Valid $N$:**\n   The number of integers $N$ in the range $5 \\cdot 10^{k-2} \\leq N < 10^k$ is:\n   \\[\n   10^k - 5 \\cdot 10^{k-2} = 10^k - 5 \\cdot 10^{k-2} = 10^k - 5 \\cdot 10^{k-2} = 10^k - 5 \\cdot 10^{k-2}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Finding the $2011^{\\text{th}}}$ Smallest $N$:**\n   We need to find the smallest $k$ such that the number of valid $N$ is at least $2011$.

      "generated_solution": "1. **Sum of Interior Angles of a Pentagon:**\n   The formula for the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = 180^\\circ (n-2))\n   \\]\n   For a pentagon ($n=5$)):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles of a pentagon} = 180^\\circ (5-2) = 180^\\circ \\times 3 = 540^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n2. **Sum of Interior Angles of an Octagon:**\n   For an octagon ($n=8$)):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles of an octagon} = 180^\\circ (8-2) = 180^\\circ \\times 6 = 1080^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n3. **Sum of Interior Angles of an $n$-gon:**\n   According to the problem, the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon equals the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon plus the sum of the interior angles of an octagon:\n   \\[\n   180^\\circ (n-2) = 540^\\circ + 1080^\\circ\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the right-hand side:\n   \\[\n   540^\\circ + 1080^\\circ = 1620^\\circ\n   \\]\n   Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   180^\\circ (n-2) = 1620^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving for $n$:**\n   Dividing both sides by $180^\\circ$:\n   \\[\n   n-2 = \\frac{1620^\\circ}{180^\\circ}} = \\frac{1620}{180} = 9\n   \\]\n   Adding 2 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   n = 9 + 2 = 11\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{11}$.",
