This is a classic problem in number theory, often referred to as the Frobenius coin problem for three coin denominations.\n\nThe Frobenius number for three coin denominations \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) is generally difficult to compute exactly without specific algorithms or computational tools. However, for the specific values given (6, 10, and 15), we can use a more practical approach by checking which values can be formed and identifying the largest value that cannot be formed.\n\nFirst, let's list out some combinations of the coins to see which values we can form:\n\n- Using only 6-cent coins, we can form values like 6, 12, 18, etc.\n- Using only 10-cent coins, we can form values like 10, 20, 30, etc.\n- Using only 15-cent coins, we can form values like 15, 30, 45, etc.\n- Using combinations of these coins, we can form more values. For example, 6 + 10 = 16, 6 + 15 = 21, 10 + 15 = 25, and so on.\n\nTo find the largest value that cannot be formed, we can start by checking the values from 1 up to a reasonable limit. We will use a systematic approach to check each value.\n\nLet's start with the smallest values and work our way up:\n\n- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 cannot be formed.\n- 6 can be formed using one 6-cent coin.\n- 7 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 8 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 9 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 10 can be formed using one 10-cent coin.\n- 11 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 12 can be formed using two 6-cent coins.\n- 13 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 14 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 15 can be formed using one 15-cent coin.\n- 16 can be formed using one 6-cent coin and one 10-cent coin.\n- 17 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 18 can be formed using three 6-cent coins.\n- 19 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 20 can be formed using two 10-cent coins.\n- 21 can be formed using one 6-cent coin and one 15-cent coin.\n- 22 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 23 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 24 can be formed using four 6-cent coins.\n- 25 can be formed using one 10-cent coin and one 15-cent coin.\n- 26 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 27 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 28 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 29 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 30 can be formed using three 10-cent coins.\n- 31 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 32 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 33 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 34 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 35 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 36 can be formed using six 6-cent coins.\n- 37 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 38 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 39 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 40 can be formed using four 10-cent coins.\n- 41 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 42 can be formed using seven 6-cent coins.\n- 43 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 44 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 45 can be formed using three 15-cent coins.\n- 46 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 47 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 48 can be formed using eight 6-cent coins.\n- 49 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 50 can be formed using five 10-cent coins.\n- 51 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 52 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 53 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 54 can be formed using nine 6-cent coins.\n- 55 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 56 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 57 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 58 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 59 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 60 can be formed using ten 6-cent coins.\n- 61 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 62 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 63 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 64 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 65 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 66 can be formed using eleven 6-cent coins.\n- 67 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 68 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 69 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 70 can be formed using thirteen 6-cent coins.\n- 71 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 72 can be formed using twelve 6-cent coins.\n- 73 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 74 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 75 can be formed using fifteen 6-cent coins.\n- 76 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 77 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 78 can be formed using thirteen 6-cent coins.\n- 79 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 80 can be formed using twenty 6-cent coins.\n- 81 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 82 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 83 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 84 can be formed using fourteen 6-cent coins.\n- 85 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 86 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 87 cannot be formed using any combination of 6, 10, and 15.\n- 88 cannot be",

There are 9 squares in total, and each pair of adjacent squares can be considered as a \"pair\" for the purpose of this problem.\n\n   To ensure that at least one of the guessed squares is covered, we need to guess at least one square from each pair. Since there are 9 squares and each pair consists of 2 squares, we can divide the 9 squares into 4 pairs (since 9 is odd, one square will be left unpaired).\n\n   Therefore, to ensure that at least one of the guessed squares is covered, we need to guess at least one square from each of the 4 pairs. This means we need at least 4 turns to ensure that at least one of the guessed squares is covered.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe minimum number of turns required to ensure that at least one of the guessed squares is covered by the hidden $2 \\times 1$ rectangle on a $3 \\times 3$ grid is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",
