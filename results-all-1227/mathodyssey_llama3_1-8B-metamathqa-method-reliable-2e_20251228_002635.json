      "generated_solution": "We can use the Remainder Theorem to find the value of $a$.\nBy the Remainder Theorem, if $x^2 - x + a$ is a factor of $x^{13} + x + 90$, then $x^2 - x + a$ divides $x^{13} + x + 90$ with a remainder of 0.\nSo, we can set up the equation $(x^2 - x + a)(x^{11} + x^9 + x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 90) = x^{13} + x + 90$.\nExpanding the left side, we get $x^{13} + x^{11} + x^9 + x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 90 + ax^{11} + ax^9 + ax^8 + ax^7 + ax^6 + ax^5 + ax^4 + ax^3 + ax^2 + ax + a = x^{13} + x + 90$.\nSimplifying, we get $ax^{11} + ax^9 + ax^8 + ax^7 + ax^6 + ax^5 + ax^4 + ax^3 + ax^2 + ax + 90 = 0$.\nSince this equation holds for all values of $x$, we can equate the coefficients of like terms on both sides.\nThis gives us the system of equations:\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a = 0$\n$a",
