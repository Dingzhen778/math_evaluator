values are distinct for all $i$.\nWe want to find the maximum value of $c$ in the given situation.\nFrom the given conditions, we know that $0 < \\frac{a_i}{b_i} < 1$ for all $i$.\nThis means that

$b_i$ values are distinct for all $i$.\nWe can rewrite the given inequality as $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}} \\geq c$.\nTo find the maximum value of $c$, we need to find the maximum value of $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}}$.\nSince $b_i$ is an even number for all $i$, we can rewrite the sum as $\\sum_{i=1}^n 2b_i$.\nWe can also rewrite $n^{\\frac{3}{2}}$ as $(n^2)^{\\frac{3}{4}}$.\nSo, the inequality becomes $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n 2b_i}{(n^2)^{\\frac{3}{4}}} \\geq c$.\nTo find the maximum value of $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n 2b_i}{(n^2)^{\\frac{3}{4}}}$, we can use the AM-GM inequality.\nThe AM-GM inequality states that for a set of positive real numbers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean.\nIn this case, the arithmetic mean is $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n 2b_i}{n}$ and the geometric mean is $\\sqrt[n]{\\prod_{i=1}^n 2b_i}$.\nSince $b_i$ is an even number for all $i$, we can rewrite the product as $\\prod_{i=1}^n 2^2b_i^2$.\nUsing the AM-GM inequality, we have $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n 2b_i}{n} \\geq \\sqrt[n]{\\prod_{i=1}^n 2^2b_i^2}$.\nSimplifying, we get $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n 2b_i}{n} \\geq \\sqrt[n]{4^n \\prod_{i=1}^n b_i^2}$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we have $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n 2b_i}{n} \\geq 2 \\sqrt[n]{\\prod_{i=1}^n b_i^2}$.\nSince $b_i$ is an even number for all $i$, we can rewrite the product as $\\prod_{i=1}^n b_i^2$.\nSo, $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n 2b_i}{n} \\geq 2 \\sqrt[n]{\\prod_{i=1}^n b_i^2}$.\nTaking the square root of both sides again, we have $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i}{n} \\geq \\sqrt[n]{\\prod_{i=1}^n b_i^2}$.\nSince $b_i$ is an even number for all $i$, we can rewrite the product as $\\prod_{i=1}^n b_i^2$.\nSo, $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i}{n} \\geq \\sqrt[n]{\\prod_{i=1}^n b_i^2}$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we have $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i}{n} \\geq \\sqrt[n]{\\prod_{i=1}^n b_i}$.\nSince $b_i$ is an even number for all $i$, we can rewrite the product as $\\prod_{i=1}^n b_i$.\nSo, $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i}{n} \\geq \\sqrt[n]{\\prod_{i=1}^n b_i}$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we have

      "question": "The king summons two wizards into the palace. He demands Wizard A to write down 100 positive real numbers on cards (allowing duplicates) without revealing them to Wizard B. Then, Wizard B must accurately write down all of these 100 positive real numbers. Otherwise, both wizards will be beheaded. Wizard A is allowed to provide a sequence of numbers to Wizard B, where each number is either one of the 100 positive real numbers or a sum of some of them. However, he cannot tell Wizard B which are the numbers on the cards and which are the sums of numbers on the cards. Ultimately, the king decides to pull off the same number of beards from both wizards based on the count of these numbers. Without the ability to communicate beforehand, the question is: How many beard pulls does each wizard need to endure at least to ensure their own survival?",

      "generated_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of participants needed to ensure that at least one person guesses correctly.\nWe can think of this as a probability problem. The probability of a participant guessing correctly is the probability that their permutation matches the host's permutation at least once.\nSince there are 100 numbers to guess, there are 100! possible permutations for the host's arrangement.\nFor each participant, there are also 100! possible permutations.\nThe probability that a participant's permutation matches the host's permutation at least once is equal to 1 minus the probability that their permutation does not match the host's permutation at all.\nThe probability that their permutation does not match the host's permutation at all is (99/100) * (98/100) * ... * (1/100) = (1/100)^100.\nTherefore, the probability that their permutation matches the host's permutation at least once is 1 - (1/100)^100.\nTo ensure that at least one person guesses correctly, we need to have a probability of 1.\nSo, we need to find the smallest integer n such that n * (1 - (1/100)^100) > 1.\nSimplifying, we have n * (1 - (1/100)^100) > 1.\nDividing both sides by (1 - (1/100)^100), we have n > 1 / (1 - (1/100)^100).\nCalculating this value, we find that n > 1.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
