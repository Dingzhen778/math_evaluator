      "reference_answer": "588",
      "predicted_answer": "324",
      "generated_solution": "We can start by finding the area of $\\triangle ABC$. Since $AD=4$, $DE=16$, and $EB=8$, we can see that $\\triangle ADE$ and $\\triangle DEB$ are similar triangles. Therefore, the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. In this case, the ratio of the areas of $\\triangle ADE$ and $\\triangle DEB$ is equal to the square of the ratio of $AD$ to $DE$, which is $(4/16)^2 = 1/16$. Therefore, the area of $\\triangle ADE$ is $1/16$ times the area of $\\triangle DEB$. Since the area of $\\triangle DEB$ is 288, the area of $\\triangle ADE$ is $288/16 = 18$.\n\nSimilarly, we can find the area of $\\triangle ACF$. Since $AF=13$, $FG=52$, and $GC=26$, we can see that $\\triangle AFG$ and $\\triangle FGC$ are similar triangles. Therefore, the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. In this case, the ratio of the areas of $\\triangle AFG$ and $\\triangle FGC$ is equal to the square of the ratio of $AF$ to $FG$, which is $(13/52)^2 = 1/16$. Therefore, the area of $\\triangle AFG$ is $1/16$ times the area of $\\triangle FGC$. Since the area of $\\triangle FGC$ is 288, the area of $\\triangle AFG$ is $288/16 = 18$.\n\nNow, we can find the area of quadrilateral $DEGF$. Since the area of $\\triangle ADE$ is 18 and the area of $\\triangle AFG$ is 18, the area of quadrilateral $DEGF$ is $18 + 18 = 36$.\n\nFinally, we can find the area of heptagon $AFNBCEM$. Since the area of quadrilateral $DEGF$ is 36 and the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is 288, the area of heptagon $AFNBCEM$ is $36 + 288 = \\boxed{324}$.The answer is: 324",

Let the lengths of the parallel sides of the trapezoid be $r$ and $s$, with $r \\neq s$.\n\nThe area of a trapezoid is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}(r + s)h$, where $h$ is the height of the trapezoid. Since the trapezoid has an inscribed circle, the height of the trapezoid is equal to the diameter of the circle, which is $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula for the area of a trapezoid, we have $72 = \\frac{1}{2}(r + s) \\times 6$. Simplifying, we get $24 = (r + s)$. Therefore, $r + s = 24$.\n\nWe are also given that the trapezoid is isosceles, which means that the lengths of the non-parallel sides are equal. Let the length of each non-parallel side be $x$. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, we have $r + s = 2x$.\n\nSubstituting the value of $r + s$ from the previous equation, we have $24 = 2x$. Simplifying, we get $x = 12$.\n\nNow, we can find the values of $r$ and $s$. Since $r + s = 24$ and $r \\neq s$, we can assume that $r = 12 + a$ and $s = 12 - a$, where $a$ is a positive integer.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation $r + s = 24$, we have $(12 + a) + (12 - a) = 24$. Simplifying, we get $24 = 24$, which is true for any value of $a$.\n\nTherefore, we can choose any positive integer value for $a$. Let's choose $a = 1$. Then, $r = 12 + 1 = 13$ and $s = 12 - 1 = 11$.\n\nFinally, we can find the value of $r^2 + s^2$. Substituting the values of $r$ and $s$, we have $r^2 + s^2 = 13^2 + 11^2 = 169 + 121 = 290$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $r^2 + s^2$ is $\\boxed{290}$.The answer is: 290",

This equation represents a circle in the complex plane with center $25+20i$ and radius 5.\n\nThe second equation can be rewritten as $|z-4-k|=|z-3i-k|$. This equation represents the set of points $z$ that are equidistant from the points $4+k$ and $3i+k$. This set of points forms a line in the complex plane.\n\nTo find the complex solution $z$, we need to find the intersection of the circle and the line. Since the line is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the center of the circle and the point $4+k$, the intersection point will be the midpoint of this segment.\n\nThe midpoint of the segment connecting $25+20i$ and $4+k$ is $\\frac{(25+20i)+(4+k))}{2} = \\frac{29+20i+k}{2}$.\n\nSince the intersection point is the midpoint of the segment, we have $\\frac{29+20i+k}{2} = z$.\n\nSubstituting this value of $z$ into the first equation, we get $|25+20i-\\frac{29+20i+k}{2}}|=5$.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get $|25+20i-\\frac{29+20i+k}{2}}|=5$.\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 2, we get $|50+40i-29-20i-k|=10$.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get $|21+20i-k|=10$.\n\nSince the absolute value of a complex number is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of its real and imaginary parts, we have $\\sqrt{(21-k)^2+(20)^2}}=10$.\n\nSquaring both sides of the equation, we get $(21-k)^2+(20)^2=100$.\n\nExpanding and simplifying this equation, we get $k^2-42k+441+400=100$.\n\nSimplifying further, we get $k^2-42k+741=0$.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find that the solutions for $k$ are $k=\\frac{42\\pm\\sqrt{42^2-4(741))}}{2}$.\n\nSimplifying this expression, we find that the solutions for $k$ are $k=\\frac{42\\pm\\sqrt{1764-2964}}{2}$.\n\nSimplifying further, we find that the solutions for $k$ are $k=\\frac{42\\pm\\sqrt{-1200}}{2}$.\n\nSince the square root of a negative number is not a real number, we conclude that there are no real solutions for $k$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible values of $k$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\nThe answer is: 0",

      "generated_solution": "The given problem involves finding the area of a finite region formed by the intersection of a plane and a set of inequalities. To solve this problem, we need to determine the vertices of the finite region and then calculate the area using the formula for the area of a triangle.\n\nFirst, let's find the vertices of the finite region. We can do this by solving the system of equations formed by the plane $x+y+z=75$ and the inequalities $x-yz<y-zx<z-xy$.\n\nSolving the system of equations, we find that the vertices of the finite region are $(25, 25, 25)$, $(0, 75, 0)$, and $(0, 0, 75)$.\n\nNext, let's calculate the area of the finite region. We can do this by using the formula for the area of a triangle, which is $\\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base of the triangle and $h$ is the height.\n\nIn this case, the base of the triangle is the distance between the points $(0, 75, 0)$ and $(0, 0, 75)$, which is $\\sqrt{(0-0)^2+(0-75)^2+(75-0)^2)} = \\sqrt{0+5625+5625} = \\sqrt{11250} = 106.066$.\n\nThe height of the triangle is the distance between the point $(25, 25, 25)$ and the line connecting the points $(0, 75, 0)$ and $(0, 0, 75)$.\n\nTo find the height, we can use the formula for the distance between a point and a line in 3-dimensional space, which is $\\frac{|ax_0+by_0+cz_0+d|}{\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}}$, where $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is the point and $ax+by+cz+d=0$ is the equation of the line.\n\nIn this case, the equation of the line connecting the points $(0, 75, 0)$ and $(0, 0, 75)$ is $x=0$.\n\nSubstituting the values into the formula, we get $\\frac{|0(25)+0(25)+75(25)+0|}{\\sqrt{0^2+0^2+75^2}}} = \\frac{|0+0+1875+0|}{\\sqrt{0+0+5625}}} = \\frac{1875}{\\sqrt{5625}}} = \\frac{1875}{75} = 25$.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the area of the finite region using the formula for the area of a triangle. The area is $\\frac{1}{2}(106.066)(25) = \\frac{1}{2}(2651.65) = 1325.825$.\n\nSince the answer must be an integer from 0 to 999, we round the area to the nearest integer, which is 1326.\n\nTherefore, the value of $a+b$ is $1326+0=\\boxed{1326}$.\n\nThe answer is: 1326",

      "generated_solution": "We can start by finding the lengths of the diagonals $AC$, $BD$, and $CE$ using the Law of Cosines.

The Fermat point is the point in the plane that minimizes the sum of the distances to the vertices of the pentagon. In this case, the Fermat point is the point $X$ that minimizes $f(X)$.\n\nTo find the Fermat point, we can use the fact that the Fermat point is the point where the sum of the distances to the vertices is minimized. In other words, the Fermat point is the point where the sum of the distances to the vertices is equal to the sum of the distances to the other vertices.\n\nLet $X$ be the Fermat point. Then we have:\n$AX + BX + CX + DX + EX = AB + BC + CD + DE + EA$\n\nSubstituting the given values, we have:\n$AX + BX + CX + DX + EX = 14 + 7 + 24 + 13 + 26$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n$AX + BX + CX + DX + EX = 110$\n\nTherefore, the least possible value of $f(X)$ is 110. We can express this value as $m+n\\sqrt{p}$, where $m=110$, $n=0$, and $p=1$. Therefore, $m+n+p=110+0+1=\\boxed{111}$.\n\nThe answer is: 111",

      "generated_solution": "We can start by finding the critical points of the function $f(x)$. To do this, we take the derivative of $f(x)$ and set it equal to 0.\n\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is given by:\n\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k)}{x} \\right]$\n\nUsing the quotient rule, we have:\n\n$f'(x) = \\frac{x \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}[(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k))]}{x^2} - \\frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k))}{x^2}$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$f'(x) = \\frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k))}{x^2} - \\frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k))}{x^2}$\n\n$f'(x) = \\frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k))}{x^2} - \\frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k))}{x^2}$\n\n$f'(x) = \\frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k))}{x^2} - \\frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k))}{x^2}$\n\nSetting $f'(x) = 0$, we have:\n\n$\\frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k))}{x^2} - \\frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k))}{x^2} = 0$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k)) = 0$\n\nThis equation has four solutions: $x = 18$, $x = 72$, $x = 98$, and $x = k$.\n\nSince the function $f(x)$ achieves its minimum value at exactly two positive real numbers $x$, we know that two of these solutions must be equal. Without loss of generality, let's assume that $x = 18$ and $x = 72$ are the two solutions that are equal.\n\nTherefore, we have $k = 18$ or $k = 72$.\n\nThe sum of these three values of $k$ is $18 + 72 + k = 90 + k$.\n\nSince $k$ can be any positive real number, the sum of these three values of $k$ can be any positive real number greater than or equal to 90.\n\nTherefore, the sum of these three values of $k$ is $\\boxed{90}$.\nThe answer is: 90",
