      "question": "Cities $A$ and $B$ are $45$ miles apart. Alicia lives in $A$ and Beth lives in $B$. Alicia bikes towards $B$ at 18 miles per hour. Leaving at the same time, Beth bikes toward $A$ at 12 miles per hour. How many miles from City $A$ will they be when they meet?",

      "predicted_answer": "27",
      "generated_solution": "We can solve this problem by finding the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet and then calculating the distance each of them has traveled.\n\nLet $t$ be the time in hours it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet. In that time, Alicia will have traveled $18t$ miles, and Beth will have traveled $12t$ miles.\n\nSince the cities are 45 miles apart, the sum of the distances traveled by Alicia and Beth should be equal to 45 miles. Therefore, we have the equation $18t + 12t = 45$.\n\nCombining like terms, we get $30t = 45$.\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 30, we find $t = \\frac{45}{30}} = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the distance each of them has traveled when they meet. Alicia will have traveled $18t = 18 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2}} = 27$ miles.\n\nTherefore, Alicia and Beth will meet 27 miles from City $A$.\n\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27\\boxed{27} 27\nThe answer is: 27 27",

Then, the number of games won by left-handed players is $1.4x$.\n\nSince each participant plays $n-1$ games, the total number of games won by right-handed players is $rx$ and the total number of games won by left-handed players is $lx(1.4)$.\n\nWe can set up the equation $rx + lx(1.4) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.\n\nSubstituting $r = 2l$ into the equation, we get $2lx + lx(1.4) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get $3.4lx = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.\n\nSince $l$ and $x$ are both positive integers, we can conclude that $3.4lx$ is a multiple of $3.4$.\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ must be a multiple of $3.4$.\n\nThe smallest multiple of $3.4$ that is greater than or equal to $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ is $3.4 \\times 100 = 340$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of games played is $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = 340$.\n\nThe answer is: 340",

      "generated_solution": "$\\frac{1}{3}$ of a large pizza together with $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices is the same as the weight of $\\frac{3}{4}$ of a large pizza together with $\\frac{1}{2}$ cup of orange slices.\n\nLet $x$ be the weight of a large pizza in pounds. Let $y$ be the weight of a cup of orange slices in pounds.\n\nWe are given that $y = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\n\n$\\frac{1}{3}x + 3 \\frac{1}{2}y = \\frac{3}{4}x + \\frac{1}{2}y$\n\nSubstituting $y = \\frac{1}{4}$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{1}{3}x + 3 \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}x + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n$\\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{13}{8}}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}x + \\frac{1}{8}}{4}$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4 to eliminate the fractions, we get:\n\n$\\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{13}{8}}{1} = 3x + \\frac{1}{8}}{1}$\n\nSimplifying further, we have:\n\n$\\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{13}{8}}{1} = 3x + \\frac{1}{8}}{1}$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 24 to eliminate the fractions, we get:\n\n$32x + 39 = 72x + 3$\n\nSubtracting $32x$ and $3$ from both sides, we have:\n\n$36 = 40x$\n\nDividing both sides by 40, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{9}{10}$\n\nTherefore, the weight of a large pizza is $\\frac{9}{10}$ pounds.\n\nTo find $m-n$, we need to find the numerator and denominator of the fraction $\\frac{9}{10}$.\n\nThe numerator is 9 and the denominator is 10.\n\nTherefore, $m-n = 9-10 = \\boxed{-1}$.\n\nThe answer is: -1\nThe answer is: -1The answer is: -1The answer is: -1The answer is: -1The answer is: -1The answer is: -1The answer is: -1The answer is: -1The answer is: -1The answer

Then the total amount of juice in the first three glasses is $3(1-x)$, and the total amount of juice in the fourth glass is $\\frac{1}{3}(1-x)$.\n\nSince all four glasses must have the same amount of juice, we have the equation $3(1-x) + \\frac{1}{3}(1-x) = 4(1-x)$.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get $3 - 3x + \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{3}x = 4 - 4x$.\n\nCombining like terms, we get $3 + \\frac{1}{3} - 3x - \\frac{1}{3}x = 4 - 4x$.\n\nSimplifying further, we get $\\frac{10}{3} - \\frac{10}{3}x = 4 - 4x$.\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fractions, we get $10 - 10x = 12 - 12x$.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get $-10x + 10x = 12 - 10$.\n\nSimplifying further, we get $0 = 2$.\n\nThis is a contradiction, so there is no solution to this problem.

We can use the given information to set up a system of equations:\n\n$a + b + c = \\frac{13}{4}$\n\n$ab + ac + bc = \\frac{11}{2}$\n\n$abc = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find that $a = \\frac{1}{2}$, $b = \\frac{1}{2}$, and $c = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the equation for $d$:\n\n$d = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2}$\n\n$d = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}}$\n\n$d = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}}$\n\n$d = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n\nTherefore, the length of the longest interior diagonal connecting two vertices of the rectangular box is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer can be written in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. In this case, $m = \\sqrt{3}$ and $n = 2$.\n\nThe sum of $m$ and $n$ is $\\sqrt{3} + 2$.\n\nSince the answer must be an integer from 0 to 999, we can round $\\sqrt{3} + 2$ to the nearest integer.\n\nThe rounded value is 3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{3}$.The answer is: 3",

      "generated_solution": "We want to find the number of integers $n$ for which the expression\\[\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log (n^2) - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3}}}\\]represents a real number.\n\nFirst, we simplify the expression inside the square root. We have\\[\\log (n^2) - (\\log n)^2 = 2\\log n - (\\log n)^2.\\]Let $x = \\log n$. Then the expression becomes\\[\\sqrt{\\frac{2x - x^2}{x - 3}}}.\\]For this expression to represent a real number, the expression inside the square root must be nonnegative. Therefore, we have\\[\\frac{2x - x^2}{x - 3}} \\ge 0.\\]We can rewrite this inequality as\\[\\frac{x^2 - 2x}{x - 3}} \\le 0.\\]We can factor the numerator as $x(x - 2)$, so the inequality becomes\\[\\frac{x(x - 2)}{x - 3}} \\le 0.\\]We can see that the expression is undefined when $x = 3$, so we exclude this value from our consideration.\n\nNext, we consider the sign of the expression. We can see that the expression is positive when $x < 0$ or $0 < x < 2$, and negative when $2 < x < 3$ or $x > 3$.\n\nTherefore, the expression represents a real number when $x < 0$ or $0 < x < 2$. In terms of $n$, this means that $n$ must be less than 1 or between 1 and 100.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers $n$ for which the expression represents a real number is $\\boxed{100}$.The answer is: 100",
