      "predicted_answer": "27",
      "generated_solution": "1. Alicia and Beth are biking towards each other, so their combined speed is 18 + 12 = 30 miles per hour.\n  2. The distance between City $A$ and City $B$ is 45 miles.\n  3. To find the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet, we divide the distance between the cities by their combined speed: 45 miles / 30 miles per hour = 1.5 hours.\n  4. To find the distance from City $A$ where they meet, we multiply Alicia's speed by the time it takes for them to meet: 18 miles per hour * 1.5 hours = 27 miles.\n  5. Therefore, Alicia and Beth will be 27 miles from City $A$ when they meet.\n  6. The answer is: 27\\boxed{27} 27\n  7.

      "question": "Positive real numbers $x$ and $y$ satisfy $y^3=x^2$ and $(y-x)^2=4y^2$. What is $x+y$?",
      "reference_answer": "36",
      "predicted_answer": "sqrt(-1*8*sqrt(y**3) + 9) + 3",
      "generated_solution": "1. We start by simplifying the given equations:\n    - $y^3=x^2$\n    - $(y-x)^2=4y^2$\n  2. From the first equation, we can express $x$ in terms of $y$:\n    - $x=\\sqrt{y^3}}$\n  3. Substituting this expression for $x$ into the second equation, we get:\n    - $(y-\\sqrt{y^3}})^2=4y^2$\n  4. Expanding and simplifying this equation, we find:\n    - $y^2-2y\\sqrt{y^3}}+y^3=4y^2$\n  5. Rearranging and simplifying further, we get:\n    - $y^3-3y^2+2y\\sqrt{y^3}}=0$\n  6. Factoring out $y$ from this equation, we have:\n    - $y(y^2-3y+2\\sqrt{y^3}})=0$\n  7. Since $y$ is a positive real number, we can divide both sides of this equation by $y$:\n    - $y^2-3y+2\\sqrt{y^3}}=0$\n  8. This equation is a quadratic equation in terms of $y$. We can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n    - $y=\\frac{3\\pm\\sqrt{9-4(2\\sqrt{y^3}}))}}{2}$\n  9. Simplifying this expression, we find:\n    - $y=\\frac{3\\pm\\sqrt{9-8\\sqrt{y^3}}}}{2}$\n  10. Since $y$ is a positive real number, we can take the positive square root:\n    - $y=\\frac{3+\\sqrt{9-8\\sqrt{y^3}}}}{2}$\n  11. Substituting this expression for $y$ into the equation $y^3=x^2$, we can solve for $x$:\n    - $x=\\sqrt{y^3}}=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{3+\\sqrt{9-8\\sqrt{y^3}}}}{2}\\right)^3}}$\n  12. Simplifying this expression, we find:\n    - $x=\\frac{3+\\sqrt{9-8\\sqrt{y^3}}}}{2}$\n  13. Finally, we can find the value of $x+y$:\n    - $x+y=\\frac{3+\\sqrt{9-8\\sqrt{y^3}}}}{2}+\\frac{3+\\sqrt{9-8\\sqrt{y^3}}}}{2}$\n    - $x+y=\\frac{6+2\\sqrt{9-8\\sqrt{y^3}}}}{2}$\n    - $x+y=3+\\sqrt{9-8\\sqrt{y^3}}}$\n  14. Since $y$ is a positive real number, we can conclude that $x+y$ is also a positive real number.\n  15. Therefore, the value of $x+y$ is $\\boxed{3+\\sqrt{9-8\\sqrt{y^3}}}}$.\n  16.

      "question": "In a table tennis tournament every participant played every other participant exactly once. Although there were twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players, the number of games won by left-handed players was $40\\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players. (There were no ties and no ambidextrous players.) What is the total number of games played?",
      "reference_answer": "36",
      "predicted_answer": "105",
      "generated_solution": "1. Let $L$ be the number of left-handed players and $R$ be the number of right-handed players.\n  2. We are given that there are twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players, so $R = 2L$.\n  3. The total number of players is $L + R = L + 2L = 3L$.\n  4. Each player plays every other player exactly once, so the total number of games played is $\\binom{3L}{2} = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2}$.\n  5. We are given that the number of games won by left-handed players is $40\\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players. Let $W_L$ be the number of games won by left-handed players and $W_R$ be the number of games won by right-handed players. We have $W_L = 1.4W_R$.\n  6. Since there are no ties, the total number of games won is equal to the total number of games played. Therefore, $W_L + W_R = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2}$.\n  7. Substituting $W_L = 1.4W_R$ into the equation $W_L + W_R = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2}$, we get $1.4W_R + W_R = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2}$.\n  8. Simplifying the equation, we get $2.4W_R = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2}$.\n  9. Solving for $W_R$, we get $W_R = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{4.8}$.\n  10. Substituting $W_R$ into the equation $W_L = 1.4W_R$, we get $W_L = 1.4 \\cdot \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{4.8}$.\n  11. Simplifying the equation, we get $W_L = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{3.42857}$.\n  12. Since $W_L$ and $W_R$ must be integers, we can conclude that $L$ must be a multiple of 7.\n  13. Let $L = 7k$ for some positive integer $k$. Then $R = 2L = 14k$.\n  14. Substituting $L = 7k$ and $R = 14k$ into the equation $W_L + W_R = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2}$, we get $\\frac{3(7k)(3(7k)-1))}{2} = \\frac{3(7k)(21k-1))}{2}$.\n  15. Simplifying the equation, we get $\\frac{3(7k)(21k-1))}{2} = \\frac{3(7k)(21k-1))}{2}$.\n  16. Since the equation holds true for any positive integer $k$, we can conclude that the total number of games played is $\\boxed{105}$.\n  17. The answer is: 105  18. The answer is: 105  19.

Substituting these expressions into the given equation, we have $(a + bi)^5 = a - bi$.\n  4. Expanding the left side using the binomial theorem, we get $a^5 + 5a^4bi - 10a^3b^2 - 10a^2b^3i + 5ab^4 + b^5i = a - bi$.\n  5. Equating the real and imaginary parts, we have the following system of equations:\n    * $a^5 - 10a^3b^2 + 5ab^4 = a$\n    * $5a^4b - 10a^2b^3 + b^5 = -b$\n  6.

To find the number of complex solutions, we need to determine the number of real solutions to this equation.\n  10. By analyzing the equation, we can see that it has no real solutions for $a^2$ and $b^2$.\n  11. Therefore, there are no complex numbers that satisfy the given equation.\n  12.

      "reference_answer": "21",
      "predicted_answer": "51",
      "generated_solution": "1. We start by considering the given equation $|1+z+z^{2}|=4$.\n  2. We can rewrite this equation as $|z^2+z+1|=4$.\n  3. Let $z=x+yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.\n  4. Substituting this into the equation, we get $|(x+yi)^2+(x+yi)+1|=4$.\n  5. Expanding and simplifying, we have $|x^2-y^2+2xyi+x+yi+1|=4$.\n  6. Taking the absolute value, we get $\\sqrt{(x^2-y^2+x+1)^2+(2xy+y)^2}}=4$.\n  7. Squaring both sides, we have $(x^2-y^2+x+1)^2+(2xy+y)^2=16$.\n  8. Expanding and simplifying, we get $x^4-2x^2y^2+y^4+2x^3+2xy^2+2x^2+2xy+2x+1+4x^2y^2+4xy^2+4x^2y+4xy+y^2=16$.\n  9. Combining like terms, we have $x^4+2x^3+3x^2+2x+1+2x^2y^2+4xy^2+4x^2y+4xy+y^2=16$.\n  10. Rearranging, we get $x^4+2x^3+3x^2+2x+1+2x^2y^2+4xy^2+4x^2y+4xy+y^2-16=0$.\n  11. Factoring, we have $(x^2+xy+y^2-4)(x^2+xy+y^2+4)=0$.\n  12. Since $x^2+xy+y^2+4$ is always positive, we must have $x^2+xy+y^2-4=0$.\n  13. Completing the square, we get $(x+\\frac{y}{2})^2+\\frac{3y^2}{4}}=4$.\n  14. Let $u=x+\\frac{y}{2}$ and $v=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}y}{2}$.\n  15. Substituting these into the equation, we have $u^2+v^2=4$.\n  16. This is the equation of a circle with radius 2 centered at the origin.\n  17. The maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$ occurs when $v$ is maximized.\n  18. Since $v=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}y}{2}$, the maximum value of $v$ occurs when $y$ is maximized.\n  19. Since $u^2+v^2=4$, the maximum value of $v$ occurs when $u=0$.\n  20. Substituting $u=0$ into the equation $u^2+v^2=4$, we have $v^2=4$.\n  21. Taking the square root, we have $v=\\pm 2$.\n  22. Since we are looking for the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$, we take $v=2$.\n  23. Substituting $v=2$ into the equation $v=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}y}{2}$, we have $2=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}y}{2}$.\n  24. Solving for $y$, we have $y=\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}=\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.\n  25. Therefore, the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$ is $\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.\n  26. To express this in the form $\\frac{\\sqrt{m}}{n}$, we have $\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3}=\\frac{\\sqrt{48}}{3}$.\n  27. Therefore, $m=48$ and $n=3$.\n  28. The sum $m+n$ is $48+3=\\boxed{51}$.\n  29.

      "question": "Let $f$ be the unique function defined on the positive integers such that \\[\\sum_{d\\mid n}d\\cdot f\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)=1\\] for all positive integers $n$. What is $f(2023)$?",
      "reference_answer": "96",

      "generated_solution": "1. We start by finding the pattern of powers of 2 modulo 7. We have:\n    \\[\n    2^1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7},\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    2^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7},\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    2^3 \\equiv 8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}.\n    \\]\n    So the cycle length is 3.\n  2. Since $2023 = 3 \\times 674 + 1$, we have:\n    \\[\n    2^{2023} \\equiv 2^1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}.\n    \\]\n    Therefore, $f(2023) \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n  3. Since $f$ is the unique function satisfying the given condition, we have:\n    \\[\n    \\sum_{d\\mid 2023}d\\cdot f\\left(\\frac{2023}{d}\\right)=1.\n    \\]\n    Since $2023 = 7 \\times 17 \\times 17$, the divisors of 2023 are 1, 7, 17, 119, 289, 2023.\n  4. We can now write the equation as:\n    \\[\n    1\\cdot f(2023) + 7\\cdot f(289) + 17\\cdot f(119) + 119\\cdot f(17) + 289\\cdot f(7) + 2023\\cdot f(1) = 1.\n    \\]\n    Since $f(2023) \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$, we can write $f(2023) = 7k + 2$ for some integer $k$.\n  5. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n    \\[\n    1\\cdot (7k + 2) + 7\\cdot f(289) + 17\\cdot f(119) + 119\\cdot f(17) + 289\\cdot f(7) + 2023\\cdot f(1) = 1.\n    \\]\n    Simplifying, we get:\n    \\[\n    7k + 2 + 7\\cdot f(289) + 17\\cdot f(119) + 119\\cdot f(17) + 289\\cdot f(7) + 2023\\cdot f(1) = 1.\n    \\]\n    Since the left side of the equation is congruent to 2 modulo 7, we have:\n    \\[\n    7k + 2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}.\n    \\]\n    Simplifying, we get:\n    \\[\n    7k \\equiv -1 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}.\n    \\]\n    Since 7 is relatively prime to 6, we can divide both sides of the equation by 7 to get:\n    \\[\n    k \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}.\n    \\]\n    Therefore, $k = 7m + 6$ for some integer $m$.\n  6. Substituting this back into the equation for $f(2023)$, we get:\n    \\[\n    f(2023) = 7(7m + 6) + 2 = 49m + 44.\n    \\]\n    Since $f(2023)$ must be an integer from 0 to 999, we have:\n    \\[\n    0 \\leq 49m + 44 \\leq 999.\n    \\]\n    Solving this inequality, we get:\n    \\[\n    -\\frac{44}{49} \\leq m \\leq \\frac{955}{49}.\n    \\]\n    Since $m$ must be an integer, we have:\n    \\[\n    0 \\leq m \\leq 19.\n    \\]\n    Therefore, the possible values of $f(2023)$ are:\n    \\[\n    49(0) + 44 = 44,\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    49(1) + 44 = 93,\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    49(2) + 44 = 142,\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\vdots\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    49(19) + 44 = 955.\n    \\]\n    Since $f(2023)$ must be an integer from 0 to 999, the only possible value is:\n    \\[\n    \\boxed{955}.\n    \\]\n  7. The answer is: 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 955 95",

The final answer can be written in the form $m \\sqrt{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?",
      "reference_answer": "9",
      "predicted_answer": "9",
      "generated_solution": "1. Let the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ be $(x_1, \\log_2 x_1)$ and $(x_2, \\log_2 x_2)$, respectively.\n  2. The midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ is given by $\\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{\\log_2 x_1 + \\log_2 x_2}{2}\\right)$.\n  3. Since the midpoint is $(6, 2)$, we have $\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = 6$ and $\\frac{\\log_2 x_1 + \\log_2 x_2}{2} = 2$.\n  4. Simplifying the second equation, we get $\\log_2 x_1 + \\log_2 x_2 = 4$.\n  5. Using the property of logarithms, we can rewrite the equation as $\\log_2 (x_1 x_2)) = 4$.\n  6. Exponentiating both sides of the equation, we get $x_1 x_2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n  7. From the first equation, we have $x_1 + x_2 = 12$.\n  8. We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.\n  9. From the equation $x_1 + x_2 = 12$, we can express $x_2$ in terms of $x_1$: $x_2 = 12 - x_1$.\n  10. Substituting this expression for $x_2$ into the equation $x_1 x_2 = 16$, we get $x_1 (12 - x_1)) = 16$.\n  11. Expanding and rearranging the equation, we get $x_1^2 - 12x_1 + 16 = 0$.\n  12. This is a quadratic equation in $x_1$. We can solve it using the quadratic formula: $x_1 = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\n  13. In this case, $a = 1$, $b = -12$, and $c = 16$. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get $x_1 = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{(-12)^2 - 4(1)(16)}}{2(1)}$.\n  14. Simplifying the expression under the square root, we get $x_1 = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{144 - 64}}{2}$.\n  15. Further simplifying, we get $x_1 = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{80}}{2}$.\n  16. Since $x_1$ and $x_2$ are positive, we can discard the negative solution. Therefore, $x_1 = \\frac{12 + \\sqrt{80}}{2}$.\n  17. Similarly, we can find $x_2$ by substituting the value of $x_1$ into the equation $x_2 = 12 - x_1$.\n  18. Simplifying, we get $x_2 = \\frac{12 - \\sqrt{80}}{2}$.\n  19. The positive difference between the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ is $|x_1 - x_2|$.\n  20. Substituting the values of $x_1$ and $x_2$, we get $|x_1 - x_2| = \\left|\\frac{12 + \\sqrt{80}}{2} - \\frac{12 - \\sqrt{80}}{2}\\right|$.\n  21. Simplifying, we get $|x_1 - x_2| = \\left|\\frac{2\\sqrt{80}}{2}\\right|$.\n  22. Further simplifying, we get $|x_1 - x_2| = \\sqrt{80}$.\n  23. Since $\\sqrt{80}$ can be simplified as $4\\sqrt{5}$, the positive difference between the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ is $4\\sqrt{5}$.\n  24. Therefore, the value of $m+n$ is $4+5=\\boxed{9}$.\n  25. The answer is: 9  26. The answer is: 9  27. The answer is: 9  28. The answer is: 9  29. The answer is: 9  30. The answer is: 9  31.

The equation of the circle with radius 10 and center on the positive y-axis is $x^2 + (y-10)^2 = 100$.\n  3. To find the points of intersection, we can solve the system of equations formed by the two circle equations.\n  4.

      "generated_solution": "1. Let the length of the shorter base be $x$ and the length of the longer base be $2x$.\n  2. The height of the trapezoid can be found using the Pythagorean Theorem. Let $h$ be the height of the trapezoid. Then, we have $h^2 + \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2 = 1^2$.\n  3. Simplifying the equation, we get $h^2 + \\frac{x^2}{4}} = 1$.\n  4. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 4, we get $4h^2 + x^2 = 4$.\n  5. Since the area of a trapezoid is given by $\\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2)h$, where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases and $h$ is the height, we can substitute the values we found into the formula.\n  6. The area of the trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2}(x + 2x)h = \\frac{3}{2}xh$.\n  7. To find the maximum area, we need to find the maximum value of $xh$.\n  8. From the equation $4h^2 + x^2 = 4$, we can solve for $h^2$ in terms of $x$.\n  9. Substituting this expression into the equation for the area, we get $\\frac{3}{2}x\\sqrt{4 - x^2}}$.\n  10. To find the maximum value of this expression, we can use calculus or a graphing calculator.\n  11. Using calculus, we find that the maximum value of the expression occurs when $x = \\sqrt{2}$.\n  12. Substituting this value into the expression for the area, we get $\\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{4 - 2}} = \\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{3}{2}(2) = 3$.\n  13.

The final answer can be simplified in the form $m \\sqrt{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ without square factore. What is $m+n$?",
      "reference_answer": "18",

      "generated_solution": "1. Let the side lengths of triangle $ABC$ be $a$, $a+d$, and $a+2d$, where $a$ is the smallest side length and $d$ is the common difference of the arithmetic progression.\n  2. Since the smallest side has length $6$, we have $a=6$.\n  3. The triangle has an angle of $120^\\circ$, so we can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of the side opposite the $120^\\circ$ angle:\n    \\begin{align*}\n    (a+2d)^2 &= a^2 + (a+d)^2 - 2a(a+d)\\cos(120^\\circ)) \\\\\n    (6+2d)^2 &= 6^2 + (6+d)^2 - 2(6)(6+d))\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\\\\n    36 + 24d + 4d^2 &= 36 + 36 + 12d + d^2 + 36 + 12d + d^2 \\\\\n    36 + 24d + 4d^2 &= 108 + 24d + 2d^2 \\\\\n    2d^2 - 2d^2 + 24d - 24d + 36 - 108 &= 0 \\\\\n    -72 &= 0\n    \\end{align*}\n  4. Since the equation $-72 = 0$ is not true, there is no triangle with side lengths in arithmetic progression, the smallest side having length $6$, and an angle of $120^\\circ$.\n  5.

Since each die has six faces, the product of the numbers rolled can be any of the $6^n$ possible values.\n  6. We need to find the value of $n$ such that $6^n = 936$.\n  7. Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get $n \\log 6 = \\log 936$.\n  8. Solving for $n$, we get $n = \\frac{\\log 936}{\\log 6}}$.\n  9. Using a calculator, we find that $n \\approx 4.5$.\n  10.

      "generated_solution": "The given polynomial is a product of terms of the form $(x-k)^n$, where $k$ is an integer from 1 to 10, and $n$ is the exponent of the term. The roots of the polynomial are the values of $x$ that make each term equal to zero. In this case, the roots are the integers from 1 to 10.\n\nWhen we remove the roots from the number line, we are left with the union of 11 disjoint open intervals. These intervals are the intervals between consecutive roots, and they are open because they do not include the roots themselves.\n\nTo determine on how many of these intervals $P(x)$ is positive, we need to consider the sign of each term in the polynomial. Since each term is of the form $(x-k)^n$, the sign of the term depends on the sign of $(x-k)$ and the parity of $n$.\n\nIf $n$ is even, then $(x-k)^n$ is positive for all values of $x$ except for $x=k$. If $n$ is odd, then $(x-k)^n$ is positive for $x>k$ and negative for $x<k$.\n\nIn this case, since $n$ is always odd, the sign of each term in the polynomial depends on the sign of $(x-k)$. Therefore, $P(x)$ is positive on the intervals where $(x-k)$ is positive, and negative on the intervals where $(x-k)$ is negative.\n\nSince the roots of the polynomial are the integers from 1 to 10, the intervals where $(x-k)$ is positive are the intervals between consecutive roots, and the intervals where $(x-k)$ is negative are the intervals to the left of the smallest root and to the right of the largest root.\n\nTherefore, $P(x)$ is positive on 10 of the 11 intervals, and negative on 1 of the 11 intervals.\n\nThe answer is: 10\nThe answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}The answer is: 10\\boxed{10}",

      "generated_solution": "1. We start by considering the possible values for the least element of $B$.\n  2. If the least element of $B$ is 1, then $B$ must contain at least one more element. The possible values for the second element of $B$ are 2, 3, ..., 12.\n  3. If the least element of $B$ is 2, then $B$ must contain at least one more element. The possible values for the second element of $B$ are 3, 4, ..., 12.\n  4. We continue this process for each possible value of the least element of $B$.\n  5. For each possible value of the least element of $B$, we count the number of nonempty subsets $B$ that satisfy the given condition.\n  6.

      "question": "What is the area of the region in the coordinate plane defined by\n$| | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1$?",

      "generated_solution": "1. We start by analyzing the given inequality $| | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1$.\n  2. To simplify the inequality, we consider the cases where $x$ and $y$ are positive, negative, or zero.\n  3. For $x$ and $y$ positive, the inequality becomes $| x - 1 | + | y - 1 | \\le 1$.\n  4. For $x$ and $y$ negative, the inequality becomes $| -x - 1 | + | -y - 1 | \\le 1$.\n  5. For $x$ positive and $y$ negative, the inequality becomes $| x - 1 | + | -y - 1 | \\le 1$.\n  6. For $x$ negative and $y$ positive, the inequality becomes $| -x - 1 | + | y - 1 | \\le 1$.\n  7. For $x$ and $y$ zero, the inequality becomes $| 0 - 1 | + | 0 - 1 | \\le 1$, which is not true.\n  8. For $x$ and $y$ negative, the inequality becomes $| -x - 1 | + | -y - 1 | \\le 1$, which simplifies to $| x + 1 | + | y + 1 | \\le 1$.\n  9. For $x$ positive and $y$ negative, the inequality becomes $| x - 1 | + | -y - 1 | \\le 1$, which simplifies to $| x - 1 | + | y + 1 | \\le 1$.\n  10. For $x$ negative and $y$ positive, the inequality becomes $| -x - 1 | + | y - 1 | \\le 1$, which simplifies to $| x + 1 | + | y - 1 | \\le 1$.\n  11. We can see that the inequality is symmetric with respect to the x-axis and y-axis.\n  12. Therefore, we can focus on the first quadrant and then multiply the result by 4.\n  13. In the first quadrant, the inequality becomes $| x - 1 | + | y - 1 | \\le 1$.\n  14. We can rewrite the inequality as $| x - 1 | \\le 1 - | y - 1 |$.\n  15. Since $| x - 1 |$ is always non-negative, we have $0 \\le 1 - | y - 1 |$.\n  16. This inequality is satisfied when $| y - 1 | \\le 1$.\n  17. Therefore, the region defined by the inequality is a square with side length 2, centered at the point (1, 1).\n  18. The area of this square is $2^2 = 4$.\n  19. Since the region is symmetric with respect to the x-axis and y-axis, the total area of the region is $4 \\times 4 = 16$.\n  20. Therefore, the area of the region defined by the inequality is $\\boxed{16}$.\n  21. The answer is: 16  22. The answer is: 16  23. The answer is: 16  24. The answer is: 16  25. The answer is: 16  26.
