We need to consider the parity (odd or even) of \\(a\\).\n\n#### Case 1: \\(a\\) is even\n\nIf \\(a\\) is even, then \\(a^p\\) is also even for any positive integer \\(p\\). Therefore, \\(b! + p\\) must also be even.\n\nSince \\(p\\) is a prime number, it is odd (except for \\(p = 2\\), which we will consider separately).\n\nThus, \\(b! + p\\) is even if and only if \\(b!\\) is odd.

This is a contradiction because an even number cannot equal an odd number.\n\nTherefore, \\(a\\) cannot be even.\n\n#### Case 2: \\(a\\) is odd\n\nIf \\(a\\) is odd, then \\(a^p\\) is also odd for any positive integer \\(p\\). Therefore, \\(b! + p\\) must also be odd.\n\nSince \\(p\\) is a prime number, it is odd (except for \\(p = 2\\), which we will consider separately).\n\nThus, \\(b! + p\\) is odd if and only if \\(b!\\) is even.

Therefore, \\(a^2\\) must be even, which implies that \\(a\\) must be even.\n\nLet \\(a = 2k\\) for some integer \\(k\\).

This is a classic problem in combinatorial game theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Knight's Movement:**\n   A knight moves in an \"L\" shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular to that direction. This means a knight can attack up to 8 squares on a standard chessboard.\n\n2. **Coloring the Chessboard:**\n   To ensure that no two knights attack each other, we can color the chessboard in a checkerboard pattern. This means alternating squares are colored black and white.\n\n3. **Placing Knights on the Chessboard:**\n   Since knights attack each other if they are on squares of the same color, we can place knights only on squares of one color (either all black or all white).\n\n4. **Counting the Number of Squares of One Color:**\n   On a \\(20 \\times 20\\) chessboard, there are \\(20 \\times 20 = 400\\) squares in total. Since the board is colored in a checkerboard pattern, half of the squares will be black and the other half will be white.\n\n   Therefore, the number of black squares is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{400}{2}} = 200\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   Since we can place knights only on squares of one color, the maximum number of knights that can be placed on the board is 200.\n\nThus, the maximal positive \\( K \\) such that, regardless of the strategy of Queenie, Horst can put at least \\( K \\) knights on the board is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{200}\n\\]",

This theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side.\n\nTherefore, we have the following inequalities:\n\n$$a + b > c$$\n$$a + c > b$$\n$$b + c > a$$\n\nNow, let's consider the possible values of $n$.

Given the recursive formula $t_{n}=\\left(\\frac{n-3}{n-1}\\right) t_{n-2}$ for $n \\geq 3$, we can analyze the behavior of the sequence.\n\nLet's start by calculating the first few terms of the sequence to identify any patterns:\n\n- $t_1 = 1$\n- $t_2 = -1$\n- $t_3 = \\left(\\frac{3-3}{3-1}}\\right) t_{3-2} = 0 \\cdot t_1 = 0$\n- $t_4 = \\left(\\frac{4-3}{4-1}}\\right) t_{4-2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}}\\right) t_2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}}\\right) \\cdot (-1) = -\\frac{1}{3}$\n\nContinuing this process, we can observe that the sequence alternates in sign and the magnitude of the terms decreases as $n$ increases.\n\nTo find $t_{1998}$, we can use the recursive formula and the observed pattern:\n\n- $t_{1998} = \\left(\\frac{1998-3}{1998-1}}\\right) t_{1998-2}$\n- $t_{1998} = \\left(\\frac{1995}{1997}}\\right) t_{1996}$\n\nSince $t_{1996}$ is the term before $t_{1998}$, we can continue this process until we reach a term we can easily calculate.\n\nHowever, without further information or a more detailed analysis of the sequence, it is not possible to provide a specific value for $t_{1998}$. The solution would require a more in-depth analysis of the sequence and its properties. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{Cannot be determined without further analysis}}}$.\n\nConclusion:\nThe problem requires a detailed analysis of the sequence and its properties. Without further information or a more detailed analysis, it is not possible to provide a specific value for $t_{1998}$. The solution would require a more in-depth analysis of the sequence and its properties. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{Cannot be determined without further

This means we can repeatedly apply this rule to reduce the argument of $f$ until we reach a value for which we know the function's value.\n\n3. **Odd Numbers Rule**: For any odd positive integer $n > 1$, we have $f(n) = f(n-1) + 1$. This rule allows us to compute the value of $f$ for any odd number by relating it to the value of $f$ for the previous even number.\n\nLet's apply these rules to find $f(50)$:\n\n- Since $50$ is even, we apply the even numbers rule:\n  \\[\n  f(50) = f\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 50}\\right) = f(25).\n  \\]\n\n- Now, $25$ is odd, so we apply the odd numbers rule:\n  \\[\n  f(25) = f(24) + 1.\n  \\]\n\n- Since $24$ is even, we apply the even numbers rule again:\n  \\[\n  f(24) = f\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 24}\\right) = f(12).\n  \\]\n\n- Continuing this process, we find that $f(12) = f(6) + 1$, and $f(6) = f(3) + 1$. Since $3$ is odd, we apply the odd numbers rule to find $f(3) = f(2) + 1$. Since $2$ is even, we apply the even numbers rule to find $f(2) = f(1) + 1$. Since $f(1) = 1$, we have $f(2) = 2$.\n\n- Substituting back, we find $f(3) = 3$, $f(6) = 4$, $f(12) = 5$, $f(24) = 6$, and finally $f(50) = 7$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $f(50)$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",

These are the only lattice points on the boundary.\n\n2. **Determine the Possible Triangles:**\n   Since the area of each triangle must be $1/2$, and the vertices of the triangles must be lattice points on the boundary of $WASH$, the only possible triangles are those with vertices at $W$, $A$, $S$, and $H$. Specifically, the possible triangles are:\n   - $\\triangle WSA$ with vertices $W$, $S$, and $A$.\n   - $\\triangle WHA$ with vertices $W$, $H$, and $A$.\n   - $\\triangle WHS$ with vertices $W$, $H$, and $S$.\n   - $\\triangle WSAH$ with vertices $W$, $S$, $A$, and $H$.\n\n3. **Count the Number of Ways to Tile the Rectangle:**\n   To tile the rectangle $WASH$ with the triangles identified above, we need to consider the possible ways to arrange these triangles. However, since the problem does not specify any additional constraints or requirements for the tiling, we assume that any arrangement of the triangles that covers the entire rectangle is valid.\n\n   Given that there are 4 possible triangles and each triangle can be used multiple times, the number of ways to tile the rectangle is infinite. This is because we can use any combination of the 4 triangles to cover the entire rectangle.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to tile the rectangle $WASH$ with triangles of area $1/2$ and vertices at lattice points on the boundary of $WASH$ is \\(\\boxed{\\infty}\\).",

      "question": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\\mathcal{N}(n)=\\{m \\mid d(m)=d(n)\\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.\n\nLater, ARMLopolis finally decides on a drastic expansion plan: now house numbers will be rational numbers. To define $d(p / q)$, with $p$ and $q$ integers such that $p q \\neq 0$, write $p / q=3^{k} p^{\\prime} / q^{\\prime}$, where neither $p^{\\prime}$ nor $q^{\\prime}$ is divisible by 3 and $k$ is an integer (not necessarily positive); then $d(p / q)=3^{-k}$.\nCompute $d(3 / 5), d(5 / 8)$, and $d(7 / 18)$.",

Therefore, the palindrome can be written as:\n   \\[\n   a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4 a_5 a_6 a_7 a_8 a_9 a_{10} a_{11} a_{12} a_{13} a_{14} a_{15}}\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4 a_5 a_6 a_7 a_8 a_9 a_{10} a_{11} a_{12} a_{13} a_{14} a_{15}}\n   \\]\n   which is:\n   \\[\n   a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4 a_5 a_6 a_7 a_8 a_9 a_{10} a_{11} a_{12} a_{13} a_{14} a_{15}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Account for the condition \"ARML\":**\n   We need to ensure that the letters \"ARML\" appear consecutively in the palindrome. This means that the letters \"ARML\" must be in the form of \"ARML\" or \"LMRA\" in the palindrome.\n\n3. **Count the number of valid palindromes:**\n   Since the letters \"ARML\" must appear consecutively, we can treat \"ARML\" as a single block. This reduces the problem to finding the number of ways to arrange the remaining letters around this block.\n\n   The remaining letters are: $\\{A, R, M, L, e, x, i, c, o, n\\}$, excluding \"ARML\". This leaves us with 11 letters.\n\n   Since the block \"ARML\" can appear in two different orders (\"ARML\" or \"LMRA\"), we need to multiply the number of ways to arrange the remaining 11 letters by 2.\n\n   The number of ways to arrange 11 letters is given by the factorial of 11, which is $11!$.\n\n   Therefore, the total number of 15-letter palindromes that can be spelled using letters in the ARMLLexicon, with the condition that there are four consecutive letters that spell out \"ARML\", is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 11! = 2 \\times 39916800 = 79833600\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{79833600}$.",

The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off.

In this case, n = 15, so we have:\n\nS_15 = 15/2 * (2a + (15-1)999))\nS_15 = 7.5 * (2a + 14*999))\nS_15 = 7.5 * (2a + 13986))\nS_15 = 7.5 * (2a + 13986))\n\nTo maximize the sum S_15, we need to maximize the value of a.

Substituting the given values, we have:\n\n$x - y = 35 - 1$\n\n$x - y = 34$\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations:\n\n1) $x^2 + y^2 = 1600$\n2) $x - y = 34$\n\nWe can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.\n\nFrom equation 2), we can express $x$ in terms of $y$:\n\n$x = y + 34$\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for $x$ into equation 1):\n\n$(y + 34)^2 + y^2 = 1600$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$2y^2 + 68y + 1156 = 1600$\n\n$2y^2 + 68y - 444 = 0$\n\nDividing the entire equation by 2, we get:\n\n$y^2 + 34y - 222 = 0$\n\nNow, we can solve this quadratic equation for $y$.

When we substitute $f(x)$ into itself, the second term will contribute to the $x^{10}$ term.\n   - The fourth term in the series is $x^4$. When we substitute $f(x)$ into itself, the fourth term will contribute to the $x^{10}$ term.\n   - The eighth term in the series is $x^8$. When we substitute $f(x)$ into itself, the eighth term will contribute to the $x^{10}$ term.\n   - The sixteenth term in the series is $x^{16}$. When we substitute $f(x)$ into itself, the sixteenth term will contribute to the $x^{10}$ term.\n\n   By analyzing the series and identifying the terms that contribute to the $x^{10}$ term, we can determine the coefficient of $x^{10}$ in $f(f(x))$.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n\n   After analyzing the series and identifying the terms that contribute to the $x^{10}$ term, we can conclude that the coefficient of $x^{10}$ in $f(f(x))$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",
