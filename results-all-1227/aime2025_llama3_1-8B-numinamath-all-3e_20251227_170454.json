      "generated_solution": "1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   We need to find the sum of all integer bases \\( b > 9 \\) such that \\( 17_b \\) is a divisor of \\( 97_b \\). Here, \\( 17_b \\) and \\( 97_b \\) represent the numbers 17 and 97 in base \\( b \\).\n\n2. **Expressing the Problem in Terms of Base 10:**\n   - In base \\( b \\), \\( 17_b \\) is represented as \\( 1b + 7 \\).\n   - In base \\( b \\), \\( 97_b \\) is represented as \\( 9b + 7 \\).\n\n3. **Setting Up the Congruence:**\n   We need \\( 17_b \\) to be a divisor of \\( 97_b \\).

This implies:\n   \\[\n   1b + 7 \\mid 7(b - 1)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1b + 7 \\mid 7b - 7\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1b + 7 \\mid 7(b - 1)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solving for \\( b \\):**\n   We need to find \\( b \\) such that \\( 1b + 7 \\) divides \\( 7(b - 1) \\). This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   1b + 7 = 7(b - 1)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1b + 7 = 7b - 7\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   7 + 7 = 7b - 1b\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   14 = 6b\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{14}{6} = \\frac{7}{3}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( b \\) must be an integer, \\( b = 7 \\).\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   The only integer base \\( b > 9 \\) for which \\( 17_b \\) is a divisor of \\( 97_b \\) is \\( b = 7 \\).\n\nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{7} \\).",

      "generated_solution": "1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have a $2 \\times 2$ grid of unit squares.\n   - Each unit square has 4 sides, and each side is colored either red or blue.\n   - Each unit square must have 2 red sides and 2 blue sides.\n\n2. **Counting the Total Number of Colorings:**\n   - Each side of the grid has 2 choices (red or blue).\n   - There are 12 sides in total.\n   - Therefore, the total number of ways to color the sides is $2^{12}$.\n\n3. **Counting the Invalid Colorings:**\n   - We need to subtract the number of colorings where at least one square does not have 2 red and 2 blue sides.\n   - We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count these invalid colorings.\n\n4. **Case 1: At least one square has 3 sides of the same color:**\n   - There are 4 squares, and each square can have 3 sides of the same color in $\\binom{4}{1} = 4$ ways.\n   - For each of these ways, the remaining 8 sides can be colored in $2^8$ ways.\n   - Therefore, the number of colorings with at least one square having 3 sides of the same color is $4 \\times 2^8$.\n\n5. **Case 2: At least two squares have 3 sides of the same color:**\n   - Choose 2 squares out of 4, which can be done in $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways.\n   - For each pair of squares, the remaining 6 sides can be colored in $2^6$ ways.\n   - Therefore, the number of colorings with at least two squares having 3 sides of the same color is $6 \\times 2^6$.\n\n6. **Case 3: All four squares have 3 sides of the same color:**\n   - This is not possible because each square must have 2 red and 2 blue sides.\n\n7. **Using Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**\n   - Total invalid colorings = Number of colorings with at least one square having 3 sides of the same color.\n   - Subtract the number of colorings with at least two squares having 3 sides of the same color.\n   - Therefore, the number of invalid colorings is $4 \\times 2^8 - 6 \\times 2^6$.\n\n8. **Calculating the Valid Colorings:**\n   - Total number of colorings = $2^{12}$.\n   - Subtract the number of invalid colorings: $2^{12} - (4 \\times 2^8 - 6 \\times 2^6)$.\n\n9. **Simplifying the Expression:**\n   - $2^{12} = 4096$.\n   - $4 \\times 2^8 = 4 \\times 256 = 1024$.\n   - $6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384$.\n   - Therefore, the number of valid colorings is $4096 - (1024 - 384) = 4096 - 640 = 3456$.\n\n10. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of valid colorings is $\\boxed{3456}$.",

      "generated_solution": "1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   We need to find the number of ways to select 8 chairs from 16 such that no two people sit next to each other. This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be approached using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion (PIE).\n\n2. **Using PIE:**\n   Let's denote the number of ways to choose \\( k \\) adjacent chairs as \\( a_k \\). We need to find \\( a_8 \\), the number of ways to choose 8 adjacent chairs.\n\n3. **Counting the Ways to Choose \\( k \\) Adjacent Chairs:**\n   - For \\( k = 1 \\) to \\( 8 \\), the number of ways to choose \\( k \\) adjacent chairs is simply \\( 16 - k + 1 \\) because we can start choosing chairs from any of the \\( 16 - k + 1 \\) possible starting positions.\n   - For \\( k = 9 \\) to \\( 16 \\), the number of ways to choose \\( k \\) adjacent chairs is \\( k - 8 \\) because we can choose any \\( k \\) chairs from the remaining \\( k - 8 \\) chairs.\n\n4. **Applying PIE:**\n   Using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, we sum the number of ways to choose \\( k \\) adjacent chairs for \\( k = 1 \\) to \\( 16 \\):\n   \\[\n   a_8 = \\sum_{k=1}^{16} (-1)^{k+1} \\binom{16}{k}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculating the Sum:**\n   We calculate the sum:\n   \\[\n   a_8 = \\sum_{k=1}^{16} (-1)^{k+1} \\binom{16}{k}\n   \\]\n   This sum can be computed using the binomial theorem or by recognizing the pattern in the alternating sum of binomial coefficients.\n\n6. **Simplifying the Sum:**\n   The sum of the binomial coefficients for all \\( k \\) from 0 to \\( n \\) is \\( 2^n \\).

For it to have exactly two positive real roots, one of the roots must be negative, and the other three roots must be positive.\n\n5. **Identify the negative root:**\n   Since the polynomial is a product of four linear factors, one of the roots must be negative. The only negative root among the given numbers is \\( k \\). Therefore, \\( k \\) must be negative.\n\n6. **Determine the positive roots:**\n   The positive roots are \\( 18, 72, \\) and \\( 98 \\). These are the roots of the polynomial \\( (x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98) \\).\n\n7. **Form the polynomial:**\n   The polynomial can be written as:\n   \\[\n   (x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k) = (x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x + k)\n   \\]\n\n8. **Solve for \\( k \\):**\n   Since \\( k \\) is negative, we can write:\n   \\[\n   (x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x + k) = (x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - |k|)\n   \\]\n   For the polynomial to have exactly two positive real roots, \\( |k| \\) must be such that the polynomial has two positive roots and one negative root.\n\n9. **Find the value of \\( k \\):**\n   Since \\( k \\) is negative, we need to find \\( |k| \\) such that the polynomial has two positive roots. The roots of the polynomial \\( (x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98) \\) are \\( 18, 72, \\) and \\( 98 \\). The fourth root must be \\( -|k| \\).\n\n10. **Determine the value of \\( |k| \\):**\n    The fourth root must be such that the polynomial has exactly two positive roots. The only way this can happen is if \\( |k| = 18 \\). Therefore, \\( k = -18 \\).\n\n11. **Sum of the values of \\( k \\):**\n    Since there are three values of \\( k \\) that satisfy the conditions, and all are equal to \\( -18 \\), the sum of these values is:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times (-18) = -54\n    \\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{-54}\\).",
