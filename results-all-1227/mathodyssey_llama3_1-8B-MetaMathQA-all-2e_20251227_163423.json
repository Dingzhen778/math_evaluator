\\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$.\nSince the point $M(3,\\sqrt{2})$ lies on the hyperbola, we can substitute these coordinates into the equation to get $\\frac{9}{a^2} - \\frac{2}{b^2} = 1$.\nSimplifying, we have $\\frac{9}{a^2} = 1 + \\frac{2}{b^2}$.\nSince $c = a$, we can substitute $c$ for $a$ in the equation to get $\\frac{9}{c^2} = 1 + \\frac{2}{b^2}$.\nSimplifying, we have $\\frac{9}{c^2} = \\frac{b^2 + 2}{b^2}$.\nCross-multiplying, we have $9b^2 = c^2(b^2 + 2)$.\nExpanding, we have $9b^2 = c^2b^2 + 2c^2$.\nSubtracting $c^2b^2$ from both sides, we have $9b^2 -
