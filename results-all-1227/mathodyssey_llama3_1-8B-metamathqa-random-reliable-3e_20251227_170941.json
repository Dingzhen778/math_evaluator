The adjugate of a $3 \\times 3$ matrix is obtained by taking the transpose of the cofactor matrix. The cofactor matrix of $A$ is $\\text{cof}(A) = \\\\left(\n         \\\\begin{array}{ccc}\n           1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\n           -1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\n           -2 & 3 & 1 \\\\\\\\\n         \\\\end{array}\n       \\\\right)$.\n\nTaking the transpose of $\\text{cof}(A)$, we get $\\text{adj}(A) = \\\\left(\n         \\\\begin{array}{ccc}\n           1 & -1 & -2 \\\\\\\\\n           0 & 1 & 3 \\\\\\\\\n           0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\n         \\\\end{array}\n       \\\\right)$.\n\nFinally, we can compute $|A^{-1}|$ using the formula $|A^{-1}| = \\frac{1}{\\text{det}(A)} \\text{det}(\\text{adj}(A))$. We have $|A^{-1}| = \\frac{1}{1} \\text{det}(\\text{adj}(A)) = \\text{det}(\\text{adj}(A)) = 1(1) - (-1)(0) - 2(0) = 1 - 0 + 0 = \\boxed{1}$.\n\nThe answer is: 1",

      "generated_solution": "The wave equation $u_{tt}-u_{xx}-u_{yy}=0$ is a linear partial differential equation, so the principle of superposition applies. This means that if $u_1$ and $u_2$ are solutions to the wave equation, then $c_1u_1+c_2u_2$ is also a solution for any constants $c_1$ and $c_2$.\n\nWe can write the solution $u$ as a sum of two functions: $u=u_1+u_2$, where $u_1$ and $u_2$ are solutions to the wave equation with initial data $u_1(0,x,y)=0$ and $u_2(0,x,y)=0$, and $u_{1t}(0,x,y)=g(x,y)$ and $u_{2t}(0,x,y)=0$.\n\nSince $u_1(0,x,y)=0$, we have $u_1(t,x,y)=0$ for all $t>0$. Therefore, $u_1$ does not contribute to the limit as $t$ approaches infinity.\n\nFor $u_2$, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let $u_2(t,x,y)=X(x)Y(y)T(t)$. Substituting into the wave equation, we get $X''YT+XYY''T=0$. Dividing both sides by $XTY$, we have $\\frac{X''}{X}+\\frac{Y''}{Y}=-\\frac{T''}{T}=k$ for some constant $k$. Since $X$ and $Y$ are functions of $x$ and $y$ respectively, we can write $\\frac{X''}{X}=-k$ and $\\frac{Y''}{Y}=-k$. Solving these equations, we find $X(x)=A\\cos(kx)+B\\sin(kx)$ and $Y(y)=C\\cos(ky)+D\\sin(ky)$ for some constants $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. Substituting back into $u_2(t,x,y)=X(x)Y(y)T(t)$, we get $u_2(t,x,y)=(A\\cos(kx)+B\\sin(kx))(C\\cos(ky)+D\\sin(ky))T(t)$.\n\nSince $u_2(0,x,y)=0$, we have $(A\\cos(kx)+B\\sin(kx))(C\\cos(ky)+D\\sin(ky))T(0)=0$. Since $T(0)$ is nonzero, we must have $A\\cos(kx)+B\\sin(kx)=0$ for all $x$. This means $A=B=0$, so $u_2(t,x,y)=0$ for all $t>0$. Therefore, $u_2$ does not contribute to the limit as $t$ approaches infinity.\n\nSince $u=u_1+u_2=0$, the limit $\\\\lim\\\\limits_{t\\\\to+\\\\infty}t^{1/4}|u(t,x,y)|$ does not exist.\n\nThe answer is: 0",
