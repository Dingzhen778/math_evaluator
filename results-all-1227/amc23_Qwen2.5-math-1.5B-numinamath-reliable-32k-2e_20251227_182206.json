Finally, we need to find \\( m + n \\).\n\n2. **Analyzing the Given Condition:**\n   The given condition is \\( |1 + z + z^2| = 4 \\). This implies that the magnitude of the complex number \\( 1 + z + z^2 \\) is 4.\n\n3. **Using the Triangle Inequality:**\n   We can use the triangle inequality to bound the magnitude of \\( z \\). The triangle inequality states that for any complex numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\),\n   \\[\n   |a + b| \\leq |a| + |b|.\n   \\]\n   Applying this to our problem, we get:\n   \\[\n   |1 + z + z^2| \\leq |1| + |z| + |z^2| = 1 + |z| + |z|^2.\n   \\]\n   Given that \\( |1 + z + z^2| = 4 \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   4 \\leq 1 + |z| + |z|^2.\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this inequality, we get:\n   \\[\n   3 \\leq |z| + |z|^2.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving the Inequality:**\n   To find the maximum value of the imaginary part of \\( z \\), we need to solve the inequality \\( 3 \\leq |z| + |z|^2 \\).

Let \\( z = iy \\) where \\( y \\) is a real number. Then \\( |z| = |iy| = |y| \\).

Solving this equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   |y|^2 + |y| - 3 = 0.\n   \\]\n   Using the quadratic formula again, we get:\n   \\[\n   |y| = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-3)}}}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 12}}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{13}}}{2}.\n   \\]\n   The maximum value of \\( |y| \\) is:\n   \\[\n   |y| = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{13}}}{2}.\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the maximum value of the imaginary part of \\( z \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\sqrt{13}}}{2}.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Expressing the Answer:**\n   The maximum value of the imaginary part of \\( z \\) is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{13}}{2} \\).

This is a classic problem in number theory, often referred to as the Frobenius coin problem for three coin denominations.\n\nThe Frobenius number for three coin denominations \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) is generally difficult to compute exactly without specific algorithms or computational tools. However, for the specific values given (6, 10, and 15), we can use a more practical approach by checking which values can be formed and which cannot.\n\nFirst, let's list some values that can be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15 cents:\n\n- \\(6\\) (using one 6-cent coin)\n- \\(10\\) (using one 10-cent coin)\n- \\(15\\) (using one 15-cent coin)\n- \\(6 + 10 = 16\\)\n- \\(6 + 15 = 21\\)\n- \\(10 + 15 = 25\\)\n- \\(6 + 10 + 15 = 31\\)\n\nWe can see that we can form the values 6, 10, 15, 16, 21, 25, and 31.

This can be verified by checking that all values from 50 to 99 can be formed, and that 49 cannot be formed.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\(x\\) is 49.
