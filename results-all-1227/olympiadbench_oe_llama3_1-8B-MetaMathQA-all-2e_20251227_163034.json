      "question": "Xenia and Sergey play the following game. Xenia thinks of a positive integer $N$ not exceeding 5000. Then she fixes 20 distinct positive integers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{20}$ such that, for each $k=1,2, \\ldots, 20$, the numbers $N$ and $a_{k}$ are congruent modulo $k$. By a move, Sergey tells Xenia a set $S$ of positive integers not exceeding 20 , and she tells him back the set $\\left\\{a_{k}: k \\in S\\right\\}$ without spelling out which number corresponds to which index.

      "generated_solution": "We can start by considering the first move. Sergey can choose any set of positive integers not exceeding 20, and Xenia will tell him the corresponding set of $a_k$ values. Since there are 20 distinct $a_k$ values, Sergey can determine the value of $N$ modulo 1, modulo 2, modulo 3, and so on, up to modulo 20. This means that after the first move, Sergey has determined the value of $N$ modulo 20.\n\nNow, let's consider the second move. Sergey can choose a different set of positive integers not exceeding 20, and Xenia will tell him the corresponding set of $a_k$ values. Since there are 20 distinct $a_k$ values, Sergey can determine the value of $N$ modulo 21, modulo 22, modulo 23, and so on, up to modulo 40. This means that after the second move, Sergey has determined the value of $N$ modulo 20 and modulo 21.\n\nContinuing in this way, Sergey can determine the value of $N$ modulo 20, modulo 21, modulo 22, and so on, up to modulo 5000. Since $N$ is a positive integer not exceeding 5000, this means that after 5000 moves, Sergey has determined the value of $N$ modulo 5000. Since $N$ is a positive integer, this means that Sergey has determined the value of $N$ itself.\n\nTherefore, Sergey needs $\\boxed{5000}$ moves to determine the number Xenia thought of.The answer is: 5000",

In this case, $f(m) + f(n) - mn = 2f(m) - m^2$ is nonzero and divides $mf(m) + nf(n) = 2mf(m)$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $2mf(m)$ is nonzero, so $2f(m) - m^2$ must be nonzero. Therefore, $2f(m) - m^2$ is a nonzero integer that divides $2mf(m)$, which means $2f(m) - m^2$ is a divisor of $2mf(m)$.\n\nNext, we consider the case when $m \\neq n$. In this case, $f(m) + f(n) - mn$ is nonzero and divides $mf(m) + nf(n)$. We can rewrite this as $f(m) - mn + f(n)$. Since $f(m) - mn$ is nonzero and divides $mf(m) + nf(n)$, we can conclude that $f(m) - mn$ is a divisor of $mf(m) + nf(n)$.\n\nTherefore, for all positive integers $m$ and $n$, $2f(m) - m^2$ is a divisor of $2mf(m)$ and $f(m) - mn$ is a divisor of $mf(m) + nf(n)$.\n\nWe can rewrite $2f(m) - m^2$ as $2f(m) - m^2 = 2(f(m) - \\frac{m^2}{2})$. Since $f(m) - \\frac{m^2}{2}$ is a divisor of $2mf(m)$, we can conclude that $f(m) - \\frac{m^2}{2}$ is a divisor of $mf(m)$.\n\nSimilarly, we can rewrite $f(m) - mn$ as $f(m) - mn = f(m) - \\frac{mn}{1}$. Since $f(m) - \\frac{mn}{1}$ is a divisor of $mf(m) + nf(n)$, we can conclude that $f(m) - \\frac{mn}{1}$ is a divisor of $mf(m)$.\n\nTherefore, for all positive integers $m$ and $n$, $f(m) - \\frac{m^2}{2}$ is a divisor of $mf(m)$ and $f(m) - \\frac{mn}{1}$ is a divisor of $mf(m)$.\n\nSince $f(m) - \\frac{m^2}{2}$ is a divisor of $mf(m)$ and $f(m) - \\frac{mn}{1}$ is a divisor of $mf(m)$, we can conclude that $f(m) - \\frac{m^2}{2}$ and $f(m) - \\frac{mn}{1}$ are equal.\n\nTherefore, for all positive integers $m$ and $n$, $f(m) - \\frac{m^2}{2} = f(m) - \\frac{mn}{1}$. Simplifying, we get $\\frac{m^2}{2} = \\frac{mn}{1}$. Since $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, we can conclude that $m^2 = 2mn$. This means $m(n - 2) = 0$. Therefore, $m = 0$ or $n = 2$.\n\nIf $m = 0$, then $f(0) - \\frac{0^2}{2} = f(0) - 0 = f(0)$. Since $f(0)$ is a divisor of $0f(0)$, we can conclude that $f(0)$ is a divisor of 0. Therefore, $f(0) = 0$.\n\nIf $n = 2$, then $f(m) - \\frac{m^2}{2} = f(m) - \\frac{2m}{1}$. Simplifying, we get $\\frac{m^2}{2} = 2m$. This means $m^2 = 4m$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, we can conclude that $m = 0$ or $m = 4$. If $m = 0$, then $f(0) - \\frac{0^2}{2} = f(0) - 0 = f(0)$. Since $f(0)$ is a divisor of $0f(0)$, we can conclude that $f(0)$ is a divisor of 0. Therefore, $f(0) = 0$. If $m = 4$, then $f(4) - \\frac{4^2}{2} = f(4) - 8 = f(4)$. Since $f(4)$ is a divisor of $4f(4)$, we can conclude that $f(4)$ is a divisor of 0. Therefore, $f(4) = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the only functions $f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ that satisfy the given conditions are $f(0) = 0$ and $f(4) = 0$. The answer is: 0",

Therefore, the gardener can ensure that there is at least one tree of height 2 on the board.\nWe can continue this pattern, where the gardener ensures that there is at least one tree of height $n$ on the board, and the lumberjack can only decrease the height of that tree by at most 4 units.\nTherefore, the gardener can ensure that there is at least one tree of height $10^6$ on the board, and the lumberjack can only decrease the height of that tree by at most 4 units.\nSince the lumberjack can only decrease the height of the tree by at most 4 units, the gardener can ensure that there are eventually $K = \\boxed{10^6}$ majestic trees on the board, no matter how the lumberjack plays.\nThe answer is: 10^6",

Since $a = 0$ and $b = 0$, we have $2ac + 2bc = 0(0) + 0(0) = 0$.\n\nFrom the fifth equation, we have $2ab + c^{2} = 0$. Since $a = 0$ and $b = 0$, we have $2ab + c^{2} = 0(0) + c^{2} = c^{2}$.\n\nFrom the sixth equation, we have $2ac + 2bc = 0$. Since $a = 0$ and $b = 0$, we have $2ac + 2bc = 0(0) + 0(0) = 0$.\n\nFrom the seventh equation, we have $c^{2} = 0$. Since $c^{2} = 0$, we have $c = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is $a = 0$, $b = 0$, and $c = 0$. Plugging these values into $f(x) = ax^{2} + bx + c$, we have $f(x) = 0x^{2} + 0x + 0 = 0$.

In this case, the common ratio is $r$.\n\nFor the three-term geometric sequence 4, $4r$, $4r^2$ to also be an arithmetic sequence, the common difference between consecutive terms must be the same.\n\nThe common difference between consecutive terms is $4r - 4$.\n\nSince the common difference is the same, we have $4r - 4 = 4r^2 - 4r$.\n\nSimplifying, we get $4r^2 - 8r + 4 = 0$.\n\nFactoring, we have $(2r - 2)(2r - 2) = 0$.\n\nThis gives us two possible values for $r$: $r = 1$ and $r = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $r$ are $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nThe answer is: 1",

We can use the formula for combinations to solve for $d$:\n\\[\\binom{d}{2} = n.\\]\nThis equation can be rewritten as:\n\\[\\frac{d!}{2!(d-2)!} = n.\\]\nSimplifying, we have:\n\\[\\frac{d(d-1)}{2} = n.\\]\nSince $n$ is a positive integer, $d$ must be an odd number. Let $d=2k+1$, where $k$ is a positive integer. Substituting into the equation, we have:\n\\[\\frac{(2k+1)(2k)}{2} = n.\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[k(2k+1) = n.\\]\nSince $k$ is a positive integer, $n$ must be a positive integer. Therefore, $n$ can be any positive integer.\n\nThe answer is: 2",

      "generated_solution": "We start by finding the decimal expansion of $100^{1000^{10,000}}$ and $1000^{10,000^{100,000}}$.\n$100^{1000^{10,000}}$ is equal to $10^{2 \\cdot 1000^{10,000}}$, which is equal to $10^{2000000}$.\nThe decimal expansion of $10^{2000000}$ has $2000000$ digits, so $X = 2000000$.\n$1000^{10,000^{100,000}}$ is equal to $10^{3 \\cdot 10,000^{100,000}}$, which is equal to $10^{30000000}$.\nThe decimal expansion of $10^{30000000}$ has $30000000$ digits, so $Y = 30000000$.\nNow we can compute $\\left\\lfloor\\log _{X} Y\\right\\rfloor$.\n$\\log_{X} Y = \\log_{2000000} 30000000 = \\frac{\\log 30000000}{\\log 2000000} \\approx

Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\\mathcal{N}(n)=\\{m \\mid d(m)=d(n)\\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.\n\nLater, ARMLopolis finally decides on a drastic expansion plan: now house numbers will be rational numbers. To define $d(p / q)$, with $p$ and $q$ integers such that $p q \\neq 0$, write $p / q=3^{k} p^{\\prime} / q^{\\prime}$, where neither $p^{\\prime}$ nor $q^{\\prime}$ is divisible by 3 and $k$ is an integer (not necessarily positive); then $d(p / q)=3^{-k}$.\nCompute $d(3 / 5), d(5 / 8)$, and $d(7 / 18)$.",

Since 28 is a factor of $k$, we can write $k$ as $28m$ for some positive integer $m$. The number of positive integer divisors of $k$ that are divisible by 28 is equal to the number of positive integer divisors of $m$.\n\nNext, let's find the number of positive integer divisors of $k$ that are divisible by 29. Since 29 is a factor of $k$, we can write $k$ as $29n$ for some positive integer $n$. The number of positive integer divisors of $k$ that are divisible by 29 is equal to the number of positive integer divisors of $n$.\n\nFinally, let's find the number of positive integer divisors of $k$ that are divisible by both 28 and 29. Since $k$ is divisible by both 28 and 29, we can write $k$ as $28m = 29n$ for some positive integers $m$ and $n$. This means that $m$ is divisible by both 28 and 29, so $m$ is divisible by 28 and 29.
