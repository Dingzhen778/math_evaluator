If each face is not an isosceles triangle, then each face must be a scalene triangle. A scalene triangle has all sides of different lengths.\n\n3. **Implications for the Edges:**\n   Since each face of the tetrahedron is a scalene triangle, each face must have three distinct edge lengths. However, since the tetrahedron has only six edges, and each edge is shared by two faces, the six edges of the tetrahedron must be the same as the three distinct edge lengths of the faces.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   Since each face of the tetrahedron is a scalene triangle, and each face has three distinct edge lengths, the tetrahedron must have at least three distinct edge lengths.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{3}$.",

It is also impossible to find four people on the spot who have three identical choices but differ pairwise in the fourth choice.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Constraints:**\n   - The first constraint implies that no two people can have the exact same combination of appetizers, main courses, desserts, and wines.\n   - The second constraint implies that no four people can have exactly three dishes in common and the fourth dish differing between each pair of these four people.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Problem:**\n   - We need to find the maximum number of guests such that the constraints are satisfied.\n   - The constraints suggest that the choices of the dishes must be carefully selected to avoid any two people having the exact same combination of dishes.\n\n3. **Constructing a Solution:**\n   - To satisfy the constraints, we can consider a combinatorial approach where each guest's choice of dishes is unique and satisfies the given constraints.\n   - One way to ensure that the constraints are satisfied is to use a combinatorial design known as a \"Steiner system.\" A Steiner system \\( S(t, k, v) \\) is a collection of \\( k \\)-element subsets (blocks) of a \\( v \\)-element set such that every \\( t \\)-element subset of the \\( v \\)-element set is contained in exactly one block.\n\n4. **Applying the Steiner System:**\n   - In our problem, we have 9 types of each dish (appetizers, main courses, desserts, and wines).\n   - We need to find a Steiner system \\( S(3, 4, 9) \\), which means we need to find a collection of 4-element subsets of a 9-element set such that every 3-element subset of the 9-element set is contained in exactly one 4-element subset.\n\n5. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Guests:**\n   - The number of 3-element subsets of a 9-element set is given by the binomial coefficient \\( \\binom{9}{3}} \\).\n   - The number of 4-element subsets of a 9-element set is given by the binomial coefficient \\( \\binom{9}{4}} \\).\n   - The maximum number of guests is the number of 4-element subsets of a 9-element set, which is \\( \\binom{9}{4}} \\).\n\n6. **Final Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{9}{4}} = \\frac{9!}{4!(9-4)!}} = \\frac{9!}{4!5!}} = \\frac{9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 126\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of guests is \\(\\boxed{126}\\).",

Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{\\sin A}} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B}} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C}}\n\\]\n\nFirst, we need to find the measure of angle $C$.

The characteristic equations are:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dt}{1}} = \\frac{dx}{2}} = \\frac{du}{0}\n   \\]\n   From $\\frac{dt}{1}} = \\frac{dx}{2}$, we get:\n   \\[\n   2t = x + C_1 \\implies C_1 = 2t - x\n   \\]\n   From $\\frac{du}{0}}$, we get:\n   \\[\n   du = 0 \\implies u = C_2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the general solution of the transport equation is:\n   \\[\n   u(t, x) = f(2t - x))\n   \\]\n   where $f$ is an arbitrary function.\n\n2. **Applying the Initial Condition:**\n\n   The initial condition is $u(0, x) = e^{-x}$ for $x > 0$. Substituting $t = 0$ into the general solution, we get:\n   \\[\n   u(0, x) = f(-x) = e^{-x}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   f(-x) = e^{-x} \\implies f(x) = e^{-x}\n   \\]\n   Hence, the solution to the transport equation with the given initial condition is:\n   \\[\n   u(t, x) = e^{-(2t - x))} = e^{x - 2t}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Applying the Boundary Condition:**\n\n   The boundary condition is $u(t, 0) = A + Bt$ for $t > 0$. Substituting $x = 0$ into the solution, we get:\n   \\[\n   u(t, 0) = e^{0 - 2t}} = e^{-2t}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   e^{-2t} = A + Bt\n   \\]\n   To satisfy this equation for all $t > 0$, we must have:\n   \\[\n   A = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad B = -2\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the values of $A$ and $B$ such that there is a solution $u(t, x)$ is $C^1$ in $\\{t \\geq 0, x \\leq 0\\}$ to the equation are $A = 1$ and $B = -2$.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1, -2}\n\\]",
