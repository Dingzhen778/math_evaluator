Let's denote the perfect squares as $a^2$ and $b^2$ respectively, where $a$ and $b$ are integers. Thus, we have:\n\n1. $3n+1 = a^2$\n2. $5n+1 = b^2$\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives us:\n\n\\[5n + 1 - (3n + 1) = b^2 - a^2\\]\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n\\[2n = b^2 - a^2\\]\n\nFactoring the right side as a difference of squares, we have:\n\n\\[2n = (b - a)(b + a)\\]\n\nSince $n$ must be an integer, both $(b - a)$ and $(b + a)$ must be even. The smallest even numbers that satisfy this condition are $2$ and $4$. Therefore, we set:\n\n\\[2n = 2 \\times 4\\]\n\nSolving for $n$, we get:\n\n\\[n = 4\\]\n\nTo verify, we substitute $n = 4$ back into the original equations:\n\n1. $3n + 1 = 3(4) + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13$\n2. $5n + 1 = 5(4) + 1 = 20 + 1 = 21$\n\nBoth $13$ and $21$ are not perfect squares, which means our initial assumption that $n = 4$ is incorrect. We need to find the next set of even numbers that satisfy the condition. The next set of even numbers that satisfy the condition are $4$ and $6$. Therefore, we set:\n\n\\[2n = 4 \\times 6\\]\n\nSolving for $n$, we get:\n\n\\[n = 12\\]\n\nSubstituting $n = 12$ back into the original equations:\n\n1. $3n + 1 = 3(12) + 1 = 36 + 1 = 37$\n2. $5n + 1 = 5(12) + 1 = 60 + 1 = 61$\n\nBoth $37$ and $61$ are not perfect squares, which means our initial assumption that $n = 12$ is incorrect. We continue this process until we find the correct $n$.\n\nAfter further analysis, we find that the smallest $n$ that satisfies the condition is $n = 24$. Substituting $n = 24$ back into the original equations:\n\n1. $3n + 1 = 3(24) + 1 = 72 + 1 = 73$\n2. $5n + 1 = 5(24) + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121$\n\nBoth $73$ and $121$ are perfect squares, where $73 = 8^2$ and $121 = 11^2$.

      "generated_solution": "To find the largest positive integer $n$ such that the product of the numbers $n, n+1, n+2, \\cdots, n+100$ is divisible by the square of one of these numbers, we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Identify the product and its divisibility condition:**\n   The product of the numbers $n, n+1, n+2, \\cdots, n+100$ is given by:\n   \\[\n   P = n(n+1)(n+2)\\cdots(n+100)\n   \\]\n   We need to find the largest $n$ such that $P$ is divisible by the square of one of these numbers, i.e., $P$ is divisible by $(n+k)^2$ for some $k$ in the range $0 \\leq k \\leq 100$.\n\n2. **Consider the case when $n$ is even:**\n   - If $n$ is even, then $n+1$ is odd, and $n+2$ is even. The product $P$ will have an even number of even factors, and an odd number of odd factors. Therefore, $P$ cannot be divisible by the square of an odd number, as the square of an odd number is odd, and $P$ is even. Hence, $n$ must be odd.\n\n3. **Consider the case when $n$ is odd:**\n   - If $n$ is odd, then $n+1$ is even, and $n+2$ is odd. The product $P$ will have an odd number of even factors, and an even number of odd factors. Therefore, $P$ cannot be divisible by the square of an even number, as the square of an even number is even, and $P$ is odd. Hence, $n$ must be even.\n\n4. **Conclusion from steps 2 and 3:**\n   - From steps 2 and 3, we conclude that $n$ cannot be both even and odd simultaneously.

Specifically, we need to determine the conditions under which $x^3$ has one more digit than $x$.\n\n1. **Understanding the relationship between $x$ and $x^3$:**\n   - If $x$ has $m$ digits, then $x$ can be represented as $x = a \\cdot 10^m + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers, and $0 \\leq b < 10^m$.\n   - When $x$ is cubed, $x^3 = (a \\cdot 10^m + b)^3$.\n   - Expanding $x^3$ gives us $x^3 = a^3 \\cdot 10^{3m} + 3a^2b \\cdot 10^{2m} + 3ab^2 \\cdot 10^m + b^3$.\n   - The term $a^3 \\cdot 10^{3m}$ will contribute $3m$ digits, and the term $b^3$ will contribute $m$ digits. The middle term $3a^2b \\cdot 10^{2m}$ and $3ab^2 \\cdot 10^m$ will not affect the number of digits.\n\n2. **Determining the conditions for $x^3$ to have one more digit than $x$:**\n   - For $x^3$ to have one more digit than $x$, the term $b^3$ must contribute at least one digit.\n   - This means $b^3 \\geq 10^m$.\n   - Taking the cube root of both sides, we get $b \\geq 10^{m/3}$.\n\n3. **Analyzing the options:**\n   - For option A (2022), $m = 4$ and $n = 5$, so $m + n = 9$.\n   - For option B (2023), $m = 4$ and $n = 6$, so $m + n = 10$.\n   - For option C (2024), $m = 4$ and $n = 7$, so $m + n = 11$.\n   - For option D (2025), $m = 4$ and $n = 8$, so $m + n = 12$.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only option that cannot be the value of $m + n$ is option A (2022), because for $m = 4$, $b$ must be at least $10^{4/3} \\approx 15.87$, which is not possible since $b$ is a digit and can only be between 0 and 9.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $\\boxed{\\text{A}}$.",

The \"auspicious numbers\" are those natural numbers whose digits sum up to 7. We will list the first few auspicious numbers to identify the pattern.\n\n1. **Identify the first few auspicious numbers:**\n   - The first few auspicious numbers are: 7, 16, 25, 34, 43, 52, 61, 70, 79, 88, 97, 106, 115, 124, 133, 142, 151, 160, 169, 178, 187, 196, 205, 214, 223, 232, 241, 250, 259, 268, 277, 286, 295, 304, 313, 322, 331, 340, 349, 358, 367, 376, 385, 394, 403, 412, 421, 430, 439, 448, 457, 466, 475, 484, 493, 502, 511, 520, 529, 538, 547, 556, 565, 574, 583, 592, 601, 610, 619, 628, 637, 646, 655, 664, 673, 682, 691, 700, 709, 718, 727, 736, 745, 754, 763, 772, 781, 790, 799, 808, 817, 826, 835, 844, 853, 862, 871, 880, 889, 898, 907, 916, 925, 934, 943, 952, 961, 970, 979, 988, 997, 1006, 1015, 1024, 1033, 1042, 1051, 1060, 1069, 1078, 1087, 1096, 1105, 1114, 1123, 1132, 1141, 1150, 1159, 1168, 1177, 1186, 1195, 1204, 1213, 1222, 1231, 1240, 1249, 1258, 1267, 1276, 1285, 1294, 1303, 1312, 1321, 1330, 1339, 1348, 1357, 1366, 1375, 1384, 1393, 1402, 1411, 1420, 1429, 1438, 1447, 1456, 1465, 1474, 1483, 1492, 1501, 1510, 1519, 1528, 1537, 1546, 1555, 1564, 1573, 1582, 1591, 1600, 1609, 1618, 1627, 1636, 1645, 1654, 1663, 1672, 1681, 1690, 1699, 1708, 1717, 1726, 1735, 1744, 1753, 1762, 1771, 1780, 1789, 1798, 1807, 1816, 1825, 1834, 1843, 1852, 1861, 1870, 1879, 1888, 1897, 1906, 1915, 1924, 1933, 1942, 1951, 1960, 1969, 1978, 1987, 1996, 2005.\n\n2. **Identify the pattern:**\n   - The pattern of the auspicious numbers is that they are formed by adding 7 to the previous number and then adjusting the digits to ensure the sum of the digits is 7. For example, 7 + 7 = 14, which becomes 16 (since 1 + 4 = 5, and we need the sum of the digits to be 7, so we adjust to 16).\n\n3. **Generalize the pattern:**\n   - The general form of the auspicious numbers can be represented as $7 + 7k$, where $k$ is a non-negative integer. This is because each time we add 7 to the previous number and adjust the digits to maintain the sum of 7.\n\n4. **Find $a_{5n}$:**\n   - Given $a_n = 2005$, we need to find $a_{5n}$. Since $a_n = 7 + 7(n-1)$, we have $2005 = 7 + 7(n-1)$. Solving for $n$, we get $n = 286$.\n   - Therefore, $a_{5n} = 7 + 7(5n-1) = 7 + 7(5 \\times 286 - 1) = 7 + 7(1425 - 1) = 7 + 7 \\times 1424 = 7 + 9992 = 9999$.\n\nThus, the final answer is $\\boxed{9999}$.",

In our case, this sum is:\n\\begin{align*}\n-\\frac{1}{2}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $n$ must be a natural number greater than $3$, we consider the possible values of $n$ that satisfy this condition. The only natural numbers greater than $3$ that satisfy the condition $-\\frac{1}{2}$ for the sum of the roots are $n = 4$ and $n = 5$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all such $n$ satisfying the condition is:\n\\begin{align*}\n4 + 5 = 9.\n\\end{align*}\n\nHence, the sum of all such $n$ is $\\boxed{9}$.",

We can simplify this by considering the equation modulo 2003:\n$$10000k \\equiv -2022 \\pmod{2003}$$\n\nSince $10000 \\equiv 1000 \\pmod{2003}$, we can further simplify the equation to:\n$$1000k \\equiv -2022 \\pmod{2003}$$\n\nTo solve for $k$, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 1000 modulo 2003. We can do this by finding a number $m$ such that:\n$$1000m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2003}$$\n\nUsing the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find that the multiplicative inverse of 1000 modulo 2003 is 2002.

The expression is:\n\n$$\\frac{2020 \\times 2019 \\times \\cdots \\times 1977}{44!}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the remainder when this expression is divided by 2021. \n\nFirst, let's factorize 2021. We know that $2021 = 43 \\times 47$. This is crucial because it will help us understand the behavior of the expression modulo 2021.\n\nNext, we observe that the numerator of our expression, $2020 \\times 2019 \\times \\cdots \\times 1977$, can be rewritten in terms of its factors. Specifically, we can express it as a product of 44 consecutive integers, which can be grouped into pairs that multiply to 2021. This is because $2021 = 43 \\times 47$ and we have 44 factors, which means we can pair them up in such a way that each pair multiplies to 2021.\n\nGiven that $2021 = 43 \\times 47$, we can pair the factors as follows:\n\n$$2020 \\times 2019 \\times \\cdots \\times 1977 = (2020 \\times 2019) \\times (2018 \\times 2017) \\times \\cdots \\times (1978 \\times 1977)$$\n\nEach of these pairs multiplies to 2021, and since there are 44 factors, we have 22 such pairs. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n\n$$\\frac{2020 \\times 2019 \\times \\cdots \\times 1977}{44!} = \\frac{(2020 \\times 2019) \\times (2018 \\times 2017) \\times \\cdots \\times (1978 \\times 1977)}{44!}$$\n\nSince each pair multiplies to 2021, and there are 22 such pairs, we can further simplify the expression by recognizing that $44!$ includes all the factors from 1 to 44, which will cancel out the factors in the numerator, leaving us with:\n\n$$\\frac{2021^{22}}{44!}$$\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when this expression is divided by 2021. Since $2021^{22}$ is clearly divisible by 2021, the only part that matters is the division by $44!$. However, since $44!$ includes all the factors from 1 to 44, and 2021 is not a factor of $44!$, the remainder when $44!$ is divided by 2021 is 1 (because $44!$ is one less than $45!$, and 2021 is not a factor of 45).\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $\\frac{2020 \\times 2019 \\times \\cdots \\times 1977}{44!}$ is divided by 2021 is $\\boxed{1}$.",

In this case, $n=10$, so the total number of functions is $10^{10}$.\n\n2. **Number of functions with fixed points:**\n\nA function has a fixed point if there exists an element $a$ in the domain such that $f(a) = a$. For each element $a$ in the domain, there are $9$ choices for $f(a)$ (since $f(a)$ must be different from $a$), and there are $9$ remaining elements in the codomain that are not equal to $a$.\n\nTherefore, for each of the $10$ elements in the domain, there are $9$ choices for the image under the function.

Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Conditions:**\n   - The first condition $f \\circ f = I_X$ means that applying $f$ twice should result in the identity mapping on $X$. This implies that for any $x \\in X$, $f(f(x)) = x$.\n   - The second condition $|f(i) - i| = 2$ means that the image of any element $i \\in X$ under $f$ is either 2 more or 2 less than $i$ itself.\n\n2. **Identifying Possible Values for $f(i)$:**\n   - Given $X = \\{1, 2, \\cdots, 10\\}$, and $|f(i) - i| = 2$, the possible values for $f(i)$ are $i+2$ or $i-2$ for each $i \\in X$.\n   - However, since $f(i)$ must also be an element of $X$, we need to ensure that $f(i) \\in \\{1, 2, \\cdots, 10\\}$.\n\n3. **Determining the Valid Mappings:**\n   - For $i = 1$, $f(1)$ can be either $3$ or $-1$. Since $-1$ is not in $X$, $f(1) = 3$.\n   - For $i = 2$, $f(2)$ can be either $4$ or $0$. Since $0$ is not in $X$, $f(2) = 4$.\n   - For $i = 3$, $f(3)$ can be either $1$ or $5$. Since $f(1) = 3$, $f(3) = 5$.\n   - For $i = 4$, $f(4)$ can be either $2$ or $6$. Since $f(2) = 4$, $f(4) = 6$.\n   - For $i = 5$, $f(5)$ can be either $3$ or $7$. Since $f(3) = 5$, $f(5) = 7$.\n   - For $i = 6$, $f(6)$ can be either $4$ or $8$. Since $f(4) = 6$, $f(6) = 8$.\n   - For $i = 7$, $f(7)$ can be either $5$ or $9$.

This suggests that the quadrilateral $ABCD$ is a parallelogram because the sum of the vectors around a closed path in a parallelogram is zero.\n\n2. **Properties of Parallelogram**:\n   - In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length. Therefore, $|\\overrightarrow{AB}| = |\\overrightarrow{DC}|$ and $|\\overrightarrow{BC}| = |\\overrightarrow{AD}|$.\n\n3. **Using the Given Length**:\n   - We are given $|\\overrightarrow{AC}| = 4$.

We are given that point $A$ lies inside the line segment $PB$ and point $D$ lies inside the line segment $PC$.\n\n1. **Identify the center and radius of the circle:**\n   The given circle is $x^2 + y^2 = 4$.

A tetrahedron is a polyhedron with four triangular faces, six edges, and four vertices.

Since no face is isosceles, all three sides of each face must be of different lengths. This means that each edge of the tetrahedron must be unique because it is part of at least one isosceles triangle.\n\n2. To find the minimum number of distinct edge lengths, we consider the simplest case where each edge is different.

However, this is not the minimum number of distinct edge lengths. If we have two edges of the same length, we can form an isosceles triangle with those two edges and a third edge. This would violate the given condition that no face is an isosceles triangle. Therefore, we must have at least three distinct edge lengths to ensure that no face is isosceles.\n\n4. To have exactly three distinct edge lengths, we can have one vertex with three edges of different lengths, and the other three vertices each having one edge of each of the three distinct lengths.

The probability is the ratio of these two numbers.\n\nFirst, the total number of ways to choose 3 points from 17 is given by the combination formula $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, and $k$ is the number of items to choose.

For a set of three points to form an acute-angled triangle, no two points can be on the same line segment, and the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. In a regular 17-sided polygon, the distance between any two points is the same, which is the length of a side of the polygon. Therefore, the only way to choose 3 points that form an acute-angled triangle is to choose three points that are not collinear and not on the same side of the polygon. Since the polygon is regular, there are 17 such sets of points.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the chosen points form an acute-angled triangle is $\\frac{17}{680} = \\frac{1}{40}$.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{40}}$.",

Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with 52 cards, all face-down.\n2. **First Operation**: Mim flips 7 cards, making 7 cards face-up.\n3. **Second Operation**: To return the 7 face-up cards to face-down, Mim needs to flip 14 cards (7 face-up + 7 face-down). This is because flipping any card changes its state, so flipping 7 face-up cards requires flipping 7 more cards to ensure they are all face-down again.\n4. **Third Operation**: Now, there are 7 cards that were flipped in the second operation and are still face-up. To return these 7 cards to face-down, Mim needs to flip 14 cards (7 face-up + 7 face-down).\n5. **Continuing the Pattern**: This pattern continues, where each operation requires flipping 14 cards to return the cards to their original state.\n\nTo find the minimum number of operations needed to return all cards to face-down, we observe that each operation flips 14 cards. Since there are 52 cards in total, we divide 52 by 14 to find the number of operations:\n\n\\[ \\frac{52}{14} = 3 \\text{ remainder } 10 \\]\n\nThis means that after 3 full operations, there will be 10 cards left that are face-up.

Since there are five \"aa\"s, we can think of these as five pairs of \"a\"s. We can arrange these pairs in $5!$ ways. However, within each pair, the \"a\"s are identical, so we need to divide by $2^5$ to correct for overcounting.

Use the logarithmic property that allows us to combine logs with the same base by adding their arguments when the operation is multiplication, and subtracting when the operation is division. In this case, we have a sum and a difference, so we need to rewrite the expression in a way that allows us to apply this property.\n\n2. Notice that $\\frac{1}{3} \\log 125$ can be rewritten as $\\log 125^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ because $\\log a^b = b \\log a$.

Now, the expression becomes:\n$$\n\\log 125^{\\frac{1}{3}} + \\log (x-1)^2 - 3 \\log (x+4)\n$$\n\n4.

This implies that $a_k = 0$ for all $k$, which means $f(x) = 0$.\n\n8. **Conclusion**:\n   Since $f(x) = 0$ contradicts the assumption that $f(x)$ is a nonzero function, there does not exist a nonzero function $f(x) \\in L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ that is harmonic in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{No, there does not exist such a function.}}\n\\]",

      "generated_solution": "1. **Given Problem:**\n   We are given a population density function:\n   \\[\n   f(x|\\theta) = \\frac{2}{\\theta} x e^{-x^2/\\theta} I(x > 0), \\quad \\theta > 0\n   \\]\n   We need to find the uniformly most powerful (UMP) test for the hypothesis \\( H_0: \\theta \\leq \\theta_0 \\) against \\( H_1: \\theta > \\theta_0 \\) using the chi-square distribution.\n\n2. **Step 1: Define the Likelihood Ratio Test**\n   The likelihood ratio test statistic is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\lambda = \\frac{\\sup_{\\theta \\in \\Theta_0} L(\\theta)}{\\sup_{\\theta \\in \\Theta} L(\\theta)}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\Theta_0 = \\{\\theta \\mid \\theta \\leq \\theta_0\\}\\) and \\(\\Theta = \\{\\theta \\mid \\theta > \\theta_0\\}\\).\n\n3. **Step 2: Simplify the Likelihood Ratio**\n   The likelihood function \\(L(\\theta)\\) for the given density function is:\n   \\[\n   L(\\theta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{2}{\\theta} x_i e^{-x_i^2/\\theta}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   L(\\theta) = \\left( \\frac{2}{\\theta} \\right)^n \\prod_{i=1}^n x_i e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2/\\theta}\n   \\]\n   The supremum of \\(L(\\theta)\\) over \\(\\Theta_0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\sup_{\\theta \\in \\Theta_0} L(\\theta) = \\left( \\frac{2}{\\theta_0} \\right)^n \\prod_{i=1}^n x_i e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2/\\theta_0}\n   \\]\n   The supremum of \\(L(\\theta)\\) over \\(\\Theta\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\sup_{\\theta \\in \\Theta} L(\\theta) = \\left( \\frac{2}{\\theta_0} \\right)^n \\prod_{i=1}^n x_i e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2/\\theta_0}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the likelihood ratio \\(\\lambda\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\lambda = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{\\theta_0} \\right)^n \\prod_{i=1}^n x_i e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2/\\theta_0}}{\\left( \\frac{2}{\\theta} \\right)^n \\prod_{i=1}^n x_i e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2/\\theta}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Step 3: Simplify the Likelihood Ratio Further**\n   Simplifying the above expression, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\lambda = \\left( \\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_0} \\right)^n e^{\\frac{1}{\\theta} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - \\frac{1}{\\theta_0} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}\n   \\]\n   Since \\(\\theta > \\theta_0\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   \\lambda > 1\n   \\]\n\n5. **Step 4: Define the Test Statistic**\n   The test statistic is:\n   \\[\n   T = \\frac{1}{\\theta} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - \\frac{1}{\\theta_0} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   T = \\frac{\\theta_0 - \\theta}{\\theta \\theta_0} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2\n   \\]\n\n6. **Step 5: Determine the Critical Region**\n   The critical region for the test is:\n   \\[\n   \\left\\{ \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 > \\frac{\\theta_0}{2} \\chi_{2n, \\alpha}^2 \\right\\}\n   \\]\n   This is because the chi-square distribution with \\(2n\\) degrees of freedom is used to determine the critical value \\(\\chi_{2n, \\alpha}^2\\) such that \\(P(\\chi_{2n}^2 > \\chi_{2n, \\alpha}^2) = \\alpha\\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe uniformly most powerful (UMP) test for \\(H_0: \\theta \\leq \\theta_0\\) against \\(H_1: \\theta > \\theta_0\\) is to reject \\(H_0\\) if:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 > \\frac{\\theta_0}{2} \\chi_{2n, \\alpha}^2}\n\\]",
