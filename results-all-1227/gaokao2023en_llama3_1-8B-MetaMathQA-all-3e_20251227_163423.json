      "question": "In trapezoid ABCD, CD and AB are the top and bottom bases respectively. AD and CB are the other two sides. Vertex A is the center of a circle, vertex D lies on the circle, and vertices B and C are right angles. If AB = 14.9 cm, BC = 5.3 cm and DC = 9.6 cm, what is the area of the sector of the circle that is the intersection of the circle and the trapezoid? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
      "reference_answer": "$22.1cm^{2}$",
      "predicted_answer": "31.5000000000000",
      "generated_solution": "First, we need to find the length of AD. Since triangle ACD is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AD. We have AD^2 = AC^2 - CD^2 = (14.9)^2 - (9.6)^2 = 221.81 - 92.16 = 129.65. Taking the square root of both sides, we find AD = 11.4 cm.\n\nNext, we need to find the area of the trapezoid. The area of a trapezoid is given by A = (1/2)(b1 + b2)h, where b1 and b2 are the lengths of the bases and h is the height. In this case, b1 = AB = 14.9 cm, b2 = CD = 9.6 cm, and h = AD = 11.4 cm. Plugging in these values, we have A = (1/2)(14.9 + 9.6)(11.4) = 24.25 cm^2.\n\nNow, we need to find the area of the sector of the circle. The area of a sector of a circle is given by A = (1/2)(θ)(r^2), where θ is the central angle in radians and r is the radius. In this case, θ is the angle formed by the intersection of the circle and the trapezoid, which is the same as angle ACD. Since angle ACD is a right angle, θ = π/2 radians. The radius of the circle is the same as the length of AD, which is 11.4 cm. Plugging in these values, we have A = (1/2)(π/2)(11.4^2) = 31.54 cm^2.\n\nTherefore, the area of the sector of the circle that is the intersection of the circle and the trapezoid is 31.54 cm^2.
