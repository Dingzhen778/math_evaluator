      "generated_solution": "1. Alicia and Beth are biking towards each other, so their combined speed is 18 + 12 = 30 miles per hour.\n  2. The distance between City $A$ and City $B$ is 45 miles.\n  3. To find the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet, we divide the distance between the cities by their combined speed: 45 miles / 30 miles per hour = 1.5 hours.\n  4. To find the distance from City $A$ where they meet, we multiply Alicia's speed by the time it takes for them to meet: 18 miles per hour * 1.5 hours = 27 miles.\n  5. Therefore, Alicia and Beth will be 27 miles from City $A$ when they meet.\n  6. The answer is: 27\\boxed{27} 27\n  7.

      "question": "Positive real numbers $x$ and $y$ satisfy $y^3=x^2$ and $(y-x)^2=4y^2$. What is $x+y$?",
      "reference_answer": "36",
      "predicted_answer": "sqrt(-1*8*sqrt(y**3) + 9) + 3",
      "generated_solution": "1. We start by simplifying the given equations:\n    - $y^3 = x^2$\n    - $(y-x)^2 = 4y^2$\n  2. From the first equation, we can express $x$ in terms of $y$:\n    - $x = \\sqrt{y^3}}$\n  3. Substituting this expression for $x$ into the second equation, we get:\n    - $(y-\\sqrt{y^3}})^2 = 4y^2$\n  4. Expanding and simplifying this equation, we find:\n    - $y^2 - 2y\\sqrt{y^3}} + y^3 = 4y^2$\n  5. Rearranging and simplifying further, we get:\n    - $y^3 - 3y^2 + 2y\\sqrt{y^3}} = 0$\n  6. Factoring out $y$ from this equation, we have:\n    - $y(y^2 - 3y + 2\\sqrt{y^3}}) = 0$\n  7. Since $y$ is a positive real number, we can divide both sides of this equation by $y$:\n    - $y^2 - 3y + 2\\sqrt{y^3}} = 0$\n  8. This equation is a quadratic equation in terms of $y$. We can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n    - $y = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 - 4(2\\sqrt{y^3}}))}}{2}$\n  9. Simplifying this expression, we find:\n    - $y = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 - 8\\sqrt{y^3}}}}{2}$\n  10. Since $y$ is a positive real number, we can take the positive square root:\n    - $y = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{9 - 8\\sqrt{y^3}}}}{2}$\n  11. Substituting this expression for $y$ into the equation $y^3 = x^2$, we can solve for $x$:\n    - $x = \\sqrt{y^3}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{3 + \\sqrt{9 - 8\\sqrt{y^3}}}}{2}\\right)^3}}$\n  12. Simplifying this expression, we find:\n    - $x = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{9 - 8\\sqrt{y^3}}}}{2}$\n  13. Finally, we can find the value of $x+y$:\n    - $x+y = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{9 - 8\\sqrt{y^3}}}}{2} + \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{9 - 8\\sqrt{y^3}}}}{2}$\n    - $x+y = 3 + \\sqrt{9 - 8\\sqrt{y^3}}}$\n  14. Since $y$ is a positive real number, we can conclude that $x+y$ is an integer from 0 to 999.\n  15. Therefore, the value of $x+y$ is $\\boxed{3 + \\sqrt{9 - 8\\sqrt{y^3}}}}$.\n  16.

      "question": "In a table tennis tournament every participant played every other participant exactly once. Although there were twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players, the number of games won by left-handed players was $40\\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players. (There were no ties and no ambidextrous players.) What is the total number of games played?",
      "reference_answer": "36",
      "predicted_answer": "36",
      "generated_solution": "1. Let $L$ be the number of left-handed players and $R$ be the number of right-handed players.\n  2. We are given that there are twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players, so $R = 2L$.\n  3. The total number of players is $L + R = L + 2L = 3L$.\n  4. Each player plays every other player exactly once, so the total number of games played is $\\binom{3L}{2} = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2}$.\n  5. We are given that the number of games won by left-handed players is $40\\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players. Let $W_L$ be the number of games won by left-handed players and $W_R$ be the number of games won by right-handed players. We have $W_L = 1.4W_R$.\n  6. Since there are no ties, the total number of games won by left-handed players is equal to the total number of games won by right-handed players, so $W_L + W_R = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2}$.\n  7. Substituting $W_L = 1.4W_R$ into the equation $W_L + W_R = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2}$, we get $1.4W_R + W_R = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2}$.\n  8. Simplifying, we get $2.4W_R = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2}$.\n  9. Solving for $W_R$, we get $W_R = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{4.8}$.\n  10. Since $W_R$ must be an integer, we can conclude that $3L(3L-1)$ must be divisible by 4.8.\n  11. The only value of $L$ that satisfies this condition is $L = 4$.\n  12. Substituting $L = 4$ into the equation $R = 2L$, we get $R = 8$.\n  13. Substituting $L = 4$ and $R = 8$ into the equation $W_L + W_R = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2}$, we get $W_L + W_R = \\frac{3(4)(4-1))}{2} = 36$.\n  14. Since $W_L = 1.4W_R$, we can conclude that $W_L = 24$ and $W_R = 12$.\n  15. The total number of games played is $\\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2} = \\frac{3(4)(4-1))}{2} = 36$.\n  16.

      "generated_solution": "1. Let $z = a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.\n  2. Then $\\overline{z} = a - bi$.\n  3. Substituting these expressions into the given equation, we have $(a + bi)^5 = a - bi$.\n  4. Expanding the left side using the binomial theorem, we get $a^5 + 5a^4bi - 10a^3b^2 - 10a^2b^3i + 5ab^4 + b^5i = a - bi$.\n  5. Equating the real and imaginary parts, we have the following system of equations:\n    * $a^5 - 10a^3b^2 + 5ab^4 = a$\n    * $5a^4b - 10a^2b^3 + b^5 = -b$\n  6. Simplifying the second equation, we get $5a^4b - 10a^2b^3 + b^5 + b = 0$.\n  7. Factoring out $b$, we have $b(5a^4 - 10a^2b^2 + b^4 + 1) = 0$.\n  8. Since $b$ cannot be zero (otherwise $z$ would be real), we must have $5a^4 - 10a^2b^2 + b^4 + 1 = 0$.\n  9. Rearranging the terms, we get $b^4 - 10a^2b^2 + 5a^4 + 1 = 0$.\n  10. This is a quartic equation in $b^2$. Let $x = b^2$. Then the equation becomes $x^2 - 10a^2x + 5a^4 + 1 = 0$.\n  11. Using the quadratic formula, we find that the solutions for $x$ are $x = \\frac{10a^2 \\pm \\sqrt{100a^4 - 4(5a^4 + 1)}}{2}$.\n  12. Simplifying the expression under the square root, we get $100a^4 - 20a^4 - 4 = 80a^4 - 4$.\n  13. Since $a$ is a real number, the expression under the square root is always nonnegative. Therefore, the equation has two real solutions for $x$.\n  14. Since $x = b^2$, each solution for $x$ corresponds to two solutions for $b$ (one positive and one negative).\n  15. Therefore, the original equation has a total of $2 \\times 2 = 4$ complex solutions.\n  16.

      "reference_answer": "5",
      "predicted_answer": "5",
      "generated_solution": "1. We need to find the number of sequences $A_1$, $A_2$, $\\dots$, $A_n$ such that $n$ is a positive integer less than or equal to $10$, each $A_i$ is a subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}$, and $A_{i-1}$ is a subset of $A_i$ for each $i$ between $2$ and $n$, inclusive.\n  2. Let's consider the number of subsets of $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}$ that can be used as $A_i$ in the sequence. Since each $A_i$ must be a subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}$, there are $2^{10} = 1024$ possible subsets.\n  3. Now, let's consider the number of sequences that can be formed using these subsets. Since $A_{i-1}$ must be a subset of $A_i$ for each $i$ between $2$ and $n$, inclusive, we can think of each subset as a \"level\" in the sequence. For example, if we have the sequence $\\{\\}$, $\\{5, 7\\}$, $\\{2, 5, 7\\}$, $\\{2, 5, 7\\}$, $\\{2, 5, 6, 7, 9\\}$, we can think of it as having 5 levels, with each level representing a subset.\n  4. To count the number of sequences, we can use the concept of \"combinations with repetition\". In this case, we have 10 \"levels\" (subsets) and we want to choose $n$ of them to form the sequence. The number of ways to do this is given by the formula $\\binom{n + 10 - 1}{10 - 1} = \\binom{n + 9}{9}$.\n  5. To find the remainder when $K$ is divided by $10$, we need to find the remainder when $\\binom{n + 9}{9}$ is divided by $10$ for each value of $n$ from $1$ to $10$.\n  6. We can use the property of binomial coefficients that $\\binom{n}{k} \\equiv \\binom{n \\mod 10}{k \\mod 10}} \\pmod{10}$ to simplify the calculation.\n  7. Using this property, we can calculate the remainder when $\\binom{n + 9}{9}$ is divided by $10$ for each value of $n$ from $1$ to $10$.\n  8. The remainders are as follows:\n    * $n = 1$: remainder is $1$\n    * $n = 2$: remainder is $2$\n    * $n = 3$: remainder is $3$\n    * $n = 4$: remainder is $4$\n    * $n = 5$: remainder is $5$\n    * $n = 6$: remainder is $6$\n    * $n = 7$: remainder is $7$\n    * $n = 8$: remainder is $8$\n    * $n = 9$: remainder is $9$\n    * $n = 10$: remainder is $0$\n  9. To find the remainder when $K$ is divided by $10$, we need to sum up the remainders for each value of $n$ from $1$ to $10$ and take the remainder when this sum is divided by $10$.\n  10. The sum of the remainders is $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 = 45$.\n  11. Taking the remainder when $45$ is divided by $10$, we get $\\boxed{5}$.\n  12. The answer is: 5  13.

The final answer can be written in the form $m \\sqrt{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?",
      "reference_answer": "9",
      "predicted_answer": "9",
      "generated_solution": "1. Let the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ be $(x_1, \\log_2 x_1)$ and $(x_2, \\log_2 x_2)$, respectively.\n  2. The midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ is given by $\\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{\\log_2 x_1 + \\log_2 x_2}{2}\\right)$.\n  3. Since the midpoint is $(6, 2)$, we have $\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = 6$ and $\\frac{\\log_2 x_1 + \\log_2 x_2}{2} = 2$.\n  4. Simplifying the second equation, we get $\\log_2 x_1 + \\log_2 x_2 = 4$.\n  5. Using the property of logarithms, we can rewrite the equation as $\\log_2 (x_1 x_2)) = 4$.\n  6. Exponentiating both sides of the equation, we get $x_1 x_2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n  7. From the first equation, we have $x_1 + x_2 = 12$.\n  8. We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.\n  9. From the equation $x_1 + x_2 = 12$, we can express $x_2$ in terms of $x_1$: $x_2 = 12 - x_1$.\n  10. Substituting this expression for $x_2$ into the equation $x_1 x_2 = 16$, we get $x_1 (12 - x_1)) = 16$.\n  11. Expanding and rearranging the equation, we get $x_1^2 - 12x_1 + 16 = 0$.\n  12. This is a quadratic equation in $x_1$. We can solve it using the quadratic formula: $x_1 = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\n  13. In this case, $a = 1$, $b = -12$, and $c = 16$. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get $x_1 = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{(-12)^2 - 4(1)(16)}}{2(1)}$.\n  14. Simplifying the expression under the square root, we get $x_1 = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{144 - 64}}{2}$.\n  15. Further simplifying, we get $x_1 = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{80}}{2}$.\n  16. Since $x_1$ and $x_2$ are positive, we can discard the negative solution. Therefore, $x_1 = \\frac{12 + \\sqrt{80}}{2}$.\n  17. Similarly, we can find $x_2$ by substituting the value of $x_1$ into the equation $x_2 = 12 - x_1$.\n  18. Simplifying, we get $x_2 = \\frac{12 - \\sqrt{80}}{2}$.\n  19. The positive difference between the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ is $|x_1 - x_2|$.\n  20. Plugging in the values of $x_1$ and $x_2$, we get $|x_1 - x_2| = \\left|\\frac{12 + \\sqrt{80}}{2} - \\frac{12 - \\sqrt{80}}{2}\\right|$.\n  21. Simplifying, we get $|x_1 - x_2| = \\left|\\frac{2\\sqrt{80}}{2}\\right|$.\n  22. Further simplifying, we get $|x_1 - x_2| = \\sqrt{80}$.\n  23. Since $\\sqrt{80}$ can be simplified as $4\\sqrt{5}$, the positive difference between the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ is $4\\sqrt{5}$.\n  24. Therefore, the value of $m+n$ is $4+5=\\boxed{9}$.\n  25. The answer is: 9  26. The answer is: 9  27. The answer is: 9  28. The answer is: 9  29. The answer is: 9  30. The answer is: 9  31.

      "question": "Maureen is keeping track of the mean of her quiz scores this semester. If Maureen scores an $11$ on the next quiz, her mean will increase by $1$. If she scores an $11$ on each of the next three quizzes, her mean will increase by $2$. What is the mean of her quiz scores currently?",
      "reference_answer": "7",
      "predicted_answer": "10",
      "generated_solution": "1. Let $x$ be the current mean of Maureen's quiz scores.\n  2. If Maureen scores an $11$ on the next quiz, her mean will increase by $1$. This means that the new mean will be $x + 1$.\n  3. If Maureen scores an $11$ on each of the next three quizzes, her mean will increase by $2$. This means that the new mean will be $x + 2$.\n  4. We can set up the following equations based on the information given:\n    * $x + 1 = \\frac{11 + \\text{sum of previous scores}}{n + 1}$\n    * $x + 2 = \\frac{11 + 11 + 11 + \\text{sum of previous scores}}{n + 3}$\n  5. We can simplify these equations as follows:\n    * $x + 1 = \\frac{11 + \\text{sum of previous scores}}{n + 1}$\n    * $x + 2 = \\frac{33 + \\text{sum of previous scores}}{n + 3}$\n  6. We can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate $x$:\n    * $(x + 2) - (x + 1) = \\frac{33 + \\text{sum of previous scores}}{n + 3} - \\frac{11 + \\text{sum of previous scores}}{n + 1}$\n    * $1 = \\frac{33 + \\text{sum of previous scores}}{n + 3} - \\frac{11 + \\text{sum of previous scores}}{n + 1}$\n  7. We can simplify this equation further as follows:\n    * $1 = \\frac{(33 + \\text{sum of previous scores})(n + 1) - (11 + \\text{sum of previous scores})(n + 3))}{(n + 3)(n + 1)}$\n    * $1 = \\frac{33n + 33 + \\text{sum of previous scores}n + \\text{sum of previous scores} - 11n - 33 - \\text{sum of previous scores}n - 3\\text{sum of previous scores}}{(n + 3)(n + 1)}$\n    * $1 = \\frac{22n - 2\\text{sum of previous scores}}{(n + 3)(n + 1)}$\n  8. We can multiply both sides of the equation by $(n + 3)(n + 1)$ to eliminate the fraction:\n    * $(n + 3)(n + 1)) = 22n - 2\\text{sum of previous scores}$\n  9. We can expand the left side of the equation as follows:\n    * $n^2 + 4n + 3 = 22n - 2\\text{sum of previous scores}$\n  10. We can rearrange the equation to isolate $\\text{sum of previous scores}$:\n    * $2\\text{sum of previous scores} = 22n - n^2 - 4n - 3$\n    * $2\\text{sum of previous scores} = -n^2 + 18n - 3$\n  11. We can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for $\\text{sum of previous scores}$:\n    * $\\text{sum of previous scores} = \\frac{-n^2 + 18n - 3}{2}$\n  12. We can substitute this expression for $\\text{sum of previous scores}$ back into the equation from step 7:\n    * $1 = \\frac{22n - 2\\left(\\frac{-n^2 + 18n - 3}{2}\\right)}}{(n + 3)(n + 1)}$\n    * $1 = \\frac{22n + n^2 - 18n + 3}{(n + 3)(n + 1)}}$\n    * $1 = \\frac{n^2 + 4n + 3}{(n + 3)(n + 1)}}$\n  13. We can simplify the right side of the equation as follows:\n    * $1 = \\frac{(n + 1)(n + 3))}{(n + 3)(n + 1)}}$\n    * $1 = 1$\n  14. Since the equation is true for all values of $n$, we can conclude that the mean of Maureen's quiz scores currently is $\\boxed{10}$.The answer is: 10  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  14  1",

      "reference_answer": "7",
      "predicted_answer": "17",
      "generated_solution": "1. Let $x$ be the fraction of a glass that Mrs. Jones must pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass.\n  2. The total amount of juice in the first three glasses is $3(1-x)$, since each glass is filled to $1-x$ of its capacity.\n  3. The total amount of juice in the fourth glass is $\\frac{1}{3}(1-x)$, since it is only $\\frac{1}{3}$ full.\n  4. To ensure that all four glasses have the same amount of juice, we need to set the total amount of juice in the first three glasses equal to the total amount of juice in the fourth glass:\n    \\[\n    3(1-x) = \\frac{1}{3}(1-x)\n    \\]\n  5. Simplifying this equation, we get:\n    \\[\n    9(1-x) = 1-x\n    \\]\n  6. Solving for $x$, we find:\n    \\[\n    x = \\frac{8}{9}\n    \\]\n  7.

      "generated_solution": "1. The equation of the circle with radius 4 and center on the positive x-axis is $(x-4)^2 + y^2 = 16$.\n  2. The equation of the circle with radius 10 and center on the positive y-axis is $x^2 + (y-10)^2 = 100$.\n  3. To find the points of intersection, we can solve the system of equations formed by the two circle equations.\n  4. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get $x^2 - (x-4)^2 = 100 - 16$.\n  5. Simplifying, we have $8x - 16 = 84$.\n  6. Solving for x, we find $x = 13$.\n  7. Substituting this value of x into either of the circle equations, we can solve for y.\n  8. Using the first circle equation, we have $(13-4)^2 + y^2 = 16$.\n  9. Simplifying, we have $81 + y^2 = 16$.\n  10. Solving for y, we find $y = \\pm 4$.\n  11. Therefore, the two points of intersection are $(13, 4)$ and $(13, -4)$.\n  12. The slope of the line passing through these two points is $\\frac{4 - (-4))}{13 - 13} = \\frac{8}{0}$.\n  13. Since the denominator is 0, the slope is undefined.\n  14. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{0}$.\n  15. The final answer is 0, which is an integer from 0 to 999.\n  16.

      "question": "Calculate the maximum area of an isosceles trapezoid that has legs of length $1$ and one base twice as long as the other. The final answer can be written in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m^2+n^2$?",

      "generated_solution": "1. Let the length of the shorter base be $x$ and the length of the longer base be $2x$.\n  2. The height of the trapezoid can be found using the Pythagorean Theorem. Let $h$ be the height of the trapezoid. Then, we have $h^2 + \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2 = 1^2$.\n  3. Simplifying the equation, we get $h^2 + \\frac{x^2}{4}} = 1$.\n  4. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 4, we get $4h^2 + x^2 = 4$.\n  5. Since the area of a trapezoid is given by $\\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2)h$, where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases and $h$ is the height, we can substitute the values we found into the formula.\n  6. The area of the trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2}(x + 2x)h = \\frac{3}{2}xh$.\n  7. To find the maximum area, we need to find the maximum value of $xh$.\n  8. From the equation $4h^2 + x^2 = 4$, we can solve for $h^2$ in terms of $x$.\n  9. Substituting this expression into the equation for the area, we get $\\frac{3}{2}x\\sqrt{4 - x^2}}$.\n  10. To find the maximum value of this expression, we can use calculus or a graphing calculator.\n  11. Using calculus, we find that the maximum value of the expression occurs when $x = \\sqrt{2}$.\n  12. Substituting this value into the expression for the area, we get $\\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{4 - 2}} = \\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{3}{2}(2) = 3$.\n  13. Therefore, the maximum area of the trapezoid is $\\boxed{3}$.\n  14. To find $m^2 + n^2$, we substitute $m = 3$ and $n = 1$ into the expression.\n  15.

      "generated_solution": "1. Let the original price of the shoes be $x$.\n  2. The price after the discount is $x - 0.2x = 0.8x$.\n  3. The sales tax is $0.075 \\times 0.8x = 0.06x$.\n  4. The total cost of the shoes including tax is $0.8x + 0.06x = 0.86x$.\n  5. Carlos has $43, so we can write: $0.86x \\leq 43$.\n  6.

The ratio of the areas of circle $A$ to circle $B$ is equal to the ratio of the squares of their radii, which is $\\left(\\frac{\\frac{5}{2}}{\\frac{13}{2}}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{5}{13}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{169}}$.\n  10. The ratio of the areas of circle $A$ to circle $B$ can be written in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.\n  11. In this case, $m = 25$ and $n = 169$.\n  12. The sum of $m$ and $n$ is $25 + 169 = 194$.\n  13. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{194}$.\n  14. The answer is: 194\n  15. The answer is: 194\n  16.

      "generated_solution": "The given polynomial is a product of terms of the form $(x-k)^n$, where $k$ is an integer from 1 to 10, and $n$ is the exponent of the term. The roots of the polynomial are the values of $x$ that make each term equal to zero. In this case, the roots are the integers from 1 to 10.\n\nWhen we remove the roots from the number line, we are left with the union of 11 disjoint open intervals. These intervals are the intervals between consecutive roots, and they are open because they do not include the roots themselves.\n\nTo determine on how many of these intervals $P(x)$ is positive, we need to consider the sign of each term in the polynomial. Since each term is of the form $(x-k)^n$, the sign of the term depends on the sign of $(x-k)$ and the parity of $n$.\n\nFor each term $(x-k)^n$, the sign of the term is positive if $(x-k)$ is positive and $n$ is even, or if $(x-k)$ is negative and $n$ is odd. Otherwise, the sign of the term is negative.\n\nSince the roots of the polynomial are the integers from 1 to 10, we can determine the sign of each term in the polynomial by considering the intervals between consecutive roots. For example, in the interval $(1,2)$, the sign of each term is positive because $(x-k)$ is positive for $k=1$ and negative for $k=2$, and $n$ is even for all terms.\n\nBy considering the sign of each term in the polynomial, we can determine on how many of the 11 intervals $P(x)$ is positive. In this case, $P(x)$ is positive on 6 of the intervals.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{6}$.The answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is: 6senal\nThe answer is:",

      "question": "For how many integers $n$ does the expression\\[\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log (n^2) - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3}}\\]represent a real number, where log denotes the base $10$ logarithm?",
      "reference_answer": "901",
      "predicted_answer": "9",
      "generated_solution": "1. We start by simplifying the expression inside the square root:\n    \\[\\frac{\\log (n^2) - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3}}\\]\n    Using the properties of logarithms, we can rewrite this as:\n    \\[\\frac{2\\log n - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3}}\\]\n    Simplifying further, we get:\n    \\[\\frac{\\log n(2 - \\log n))}{\\log n - 3}}\\]\n    2. For the expression inside the square root to be real, the numerator must be non-negative and the denominator must be non-zero.\n    3. The numerator is non-negative when $\\log n(2 - \\log n)) \\geq 0$.\n    4. The denominator is non-zero when $\\log n - 3 \\neq 0$.\n    5. Solving these inequalities, we find that the expression inside the square root is real for $n = 10^2, 10^3, \\dots, 10^9$.\n    6. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{9}$ integers $n$ for which the expression represents a real number.\n  2.
