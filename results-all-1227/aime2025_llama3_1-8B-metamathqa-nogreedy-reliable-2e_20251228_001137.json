      "generated_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of subsets of 16 chairs that could be selected such that no person sits next to two other people.\nWe can approach this problem by considering the number of ways to arrange the people on the chairs.\nIf we consider the first person, there are 16 choices for their chair.\nFor the second person, there are 15 choices for their chair, since they cannot sit next to the first person.\nSimilarly, for the third person, there are 14 choices for their chair, and so on.\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements is $16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9$.\nTo find the remainder when this number is divided by 1000, we can calculate the remainder of each factor and then multiply them together.\nThe remainder of $16$ divided by $1000$ is $16$.\nThe remainder of $15$ divided by $1000$ is $15$.\nThe remainder of $14$ divided by $1000$ is $14$.\nThe remainder of $13$
