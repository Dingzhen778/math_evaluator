      "generated_solution": "1. We need to find the number of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 22.\n  2. A number is divisible by 22 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 11.\n  3. A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even.\n  4. A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions is divisible by 11.\n  5. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 22.\n  6. Let $A$ be the set of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 2, and let $B$ be the set of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 11.\n  7. We want to find $|A \\cap B|$.\n  8. By the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have $|A \\cap B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cup B|$.\n  9. We can count the number of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 2 and the number of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 11 separately.\n  10. The number of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 2 is $\\frac{8!}{2} = 20160$.\n  11. The number of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 11 is $\\frac{8!}{11} = 20160$.\n  12. The number of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 22 is $|A \\cap B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cup B| = 20160 + 20160 - 40320 = 0$.\n  13.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the boundaries of the region and then calculate its area.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the inequalities in a more convenient form:\n$x-yz<y-zx<z-xy$\n\nWe can simplify these inequalities by subtracting the middle term from each inequality:\n$x-yz-y+zx<0$\n$z-xy-y+zx<0$\n\nNow, let's consider the plane $x+y+z=75$. We can rewrite this equation as $z=75-x-y$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $z$ into the simplified inequalities, we get:\n$x-y(75-x-y))<0$\n$(75-x-y)-xy-y<0$\n\nSimplifying these inequalities, we have:\n$x-y(75-x-y))<0$\n$75-x-y-xy-y<0$\n\nNow, let's analyze the first inequality:\n$x-y(75-x-y))<0$\n\nWe can rewrite this inequality as:\n$x-y(75-x-y))<0$\n$x-y(75-x-y))<0$\n$x-y(75-x-y))<0$\n\nThis inequality represents a region in the coordinate space.

To find the boundaries of this region, we need to determine the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy this inequality.\n\nNow, let's consider the intersection of these two regions. The intersection represents the finite region that we are interested in.\n\nTo calculate the area of this finite region, we need to determine the boundaries of the region and then use integration to find the area.\n\nUnfortunately, the given problem does not provide enough information to determine the boundaries of the region and calculate its area.

To find the expected number of regions, we need to consider the probability of each line segment intersecting with the existing line segments.\n  4. Let's consider the probability of a line segment intersecting with a specific existing line segment.\n  5. Since the line segments are drawn randomly, the probability of intersecting with a specific existing line segment is 1/2.\n  6.

Therefore, the expected number of regions into which the 27 line segments divide the disk is \\boxed{40}.\n\nThe answer is: 40 2023 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2",

      "reference_answer": "82",
      "predicted_answer": "16",
      "generated_solution": "1. We can start by coloring the top-left square. There are 2 choices for the color of each side, so there are $2^4=16$ possible colorings for the top-left square.\n  2. Now, let's consider the top-right square. Since each unit square has 2 red sides and 2 blue sides, the top-right square must have the same color pattern as the top-left square. Therefore, there is only 1 choice for the color of each side of the top-right square.\n  3. Similarly, the bottom-left square must have the same color pattern as the top-left square, so there is only 1 choice for the color of each side of the bottom-left square.\n  4. Finally, the bottom-right square must have the same color pattern as the top-left square, so there is only 1 choice for the color of each side of the bottom-right square.\n  5. Therefore, the total number of such colorings is $16 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = \\boxed{16}$.\n  6.

There are a total of $(4+1)(2+1) = 5 \\cdot 3 = 15$ divisors of 2025.\n\nTo find the probability that a randomly selected subset $B$ of $A$ has the property that the least common multiple of its elements is 2025, we need to count the number of subsets $B$ that satisfy this property.\n\nA subset $B$ will have the property that the least common multiple of its elements is 2025 if and only if $B$ contains at least one divisor of 2025 that is divisible by $3^4$ and at least one divisor of 2025 that is divisible by $5^2$.\n\nThere are 5 divisors of 2025 that are divisible by $3^4$ and 3 divisors of 2025 that are divisible by $5^2$. Therefore, there are $5 \\cdot 3 = 15$ subsets $B$ that satisfy the given property.\n\nThe total number of subsets of $A$ is $2^{15}$, since each divisor of 2025 can either be included or excluded from a subset.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected subset $B$ of $A$ has the property that the least common multiple of its elements is 2025 is $\\frac{15}{2^{15}}$.\n\nSimplifying this fraction, we get $\\frac{15}{32768}$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $15 + 32768 = \\boxed{32783}$.The answer is: 32783\nThe answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The answer is: 32783The",

      "question": "From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $ N $ cents, where $ N $ is a positive integer. He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.",

      "generated_solution": "1. We need to find the number of subsets of 16 chairs that could be selected.\n  2. Since no person can sit next to two other people, we can think of the chairs as being arranged in a row with gaps between them.\n  3. We can represent the gaps between the chairs as 16 - 8 = 8 gaps.\n  4. To find the number of subsets of 16 chairs, we can use the concept of combinations.\n  5. The number of subsets of 16 chairs is equal to the number of ways to choose 8 gaps out of the 8 available gaps.\n  6. This can be calculated using the combination formula: C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!))\n  7. In this case, n = 8 and r = 8, so the number of subsets of 16 chairs is C(8, 8) = 8! / (8!(8-8)!)) = 1.\n  8.

      "generated_solution": "1. We can start by considering the number of ways to draw 12 segments of equal lengths from the 24 vertices of the regular 24-gon.\n  2. Since each vertex must be an endpoint of exactly one of the 12 segments, we can think of this as a permutation problem.\n  3. The number of ways to arrange 12 segments among 24 vertices is given by the formula $\\frac{24!}{(24-12)! \\cdot 12!}}$.\n  4. Simplifying this expression, we get $\\frac{24!}{12! \\cdot 12!}}$.\n  5. Using the factorial function, we can calculate the value of this expression.\n  6. The final answer is $\\boxed{2704156}$.\n  7. The answer is an integer from 0 to 999, as required.\n  8.
