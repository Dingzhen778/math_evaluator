There are 24 possible positions for Chris and Abby, and for each position, there are 2 possible positions for Charlie (either to the left or to the right of Chris and Abby). Therefore, there are \\( 24 \\times 2 = 48 \\) ways for Charlie to be next to both Chris and Abby. The total number of ways to arrange the 25 people is \\( 25! \\). Therefore, the probability that Charlie is next to both Chris and Abby is:\n     \\[\n     P(A \\cap B) = \\frac{48 \\times 24!}{25!}} = \\frac{48}{25}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Combining the probabilities:**\n\n   - Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have:\n     \\[\n     P(A \\cup B) = \\frac{48}{25} + \\frac{48}{25} - \\frac{48}{25}}{25}\n     \\]\n\n   - Simplifying the expression, we get:\n     \\[\n     P(A \\cup B) = \\frac{48}{25} + \\frac{48}{25} - \\frac{48}{25}}{25}\n     \\]\n\n   - Therefore, the probability that Charlie is not next to either Chris or Abby is:\n     \\[\n     P(\\text{Charlie not next to Chris or Abby}}) = 1 - P(A \\cup B)\n     \\]\n\n   - Simplifying the expression, we get:\n     \\[\n     P(\\text{Charlie not next to Chris or Abby}}) = 1 - \\frac{48}{25} + \\frac{48}{25} - \\frac{48}{25}}{25}}\n     \\]\n\n   - Therefore, the final answer is:\n     \\[\n     \\boxed{\\frac{1}{25}}}\n     \\]",

      "generated_solution": "To solve the problem of finding the greatest fibbish number, we need to understand the definition of a fibbish number. A positive integer is fibbish if each digit, after the leftmost two, is at least the sum of the previous two digits.\n\nLet's start by considering the largest possible digit, which is 9. We need to check if we can form a number using 9s that satisfies the fibbish condition.\n\n1. **Check the first two digits:**\n   - The first two digits can be any combination of digits from 0 to 9. However, to maximize the number, we should start with the largest possible digits.\n\n2. **Check the subsequent digits:**\n   - For a number to be fibbish, each digit after the first two must be at least the sum of the previous two digits.\n   - Let's consider the largest possible digit, which is 9. If we have two 9s as the first two digits, the next digit must be at least 9 + 9 = 18. However, since we are dealing with single digits, this is not possible.\n\n3. **Consider smaller digits:**\n   - To satisfy the fibbish condition, we need to find a combination of digits that allows each subsequent digit to be at least the sum of the previous two digits.\n   - Let's try with smaller digits. If we start with two 5s as the first two digits, the next digit must be at least 5 + 5 = 10. However, since we are dealing with single digits, this is not possible.\n\n4. **Find the largest possible fibbish number:**\n   - After trying different combinations of digits, we find that the largest possible fibbish number is 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999",

Square both sides to eliminate the outer square root:\n   \\[\n   20 + \\sqrt{T + x} = 25\n   \\]\n\n3. Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the inner square root:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{T + x} = 5\n   \\]\n\n4. Square both sides again to eliminate the inner square root:\n   \\[\n   T + x = 25\n   \\]\n\n5. Substitute the given value of \\( T = 11 \\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   11 + x = 25\n   \\]\n\n6. Subtract 11 from both sides to solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 25 - 11\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 14\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{14} \\).",

      "generated_solution": "1. **Sum of Interior Angles of a Pentagon:**\n   The formula for the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles} = 180^\\circ (n-2))\n   \\]\n   For a pentagon ($n=5$)):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles of a pentagon} = 180^\\circ (5-2) = 180^\\circ \\times 3 = 540^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n2. **Sum of Interior Angles of an Octagon:**\n   For an octagon ($n=8$)):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of interior angles of an octagon} = 180^\\circ (8-2) = 180^\\circ \\times 6 = 1080^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n3. **Sum of Interior Angles of an $n$-gon:**\n   According to the problem, the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon equals the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon plus the sum of the interior angles of an octagon:\n   \\[\n   180^\\circ (n-2) = 540^\\circ + 1080^\\circ\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the right-hand side:\n   \\[\n   540^\\circ + 1080^\\circ = 1620^\\circ\n   \\]\n   Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   180^\\circ (n-2) = 1620^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving for $n$:**\n   Dividing both sides by $180^\\circ$:\n   \\[\n   n-2 = \\frac{1620^\\circ}{180^\\circ}} = \\frac{1620}{180} = 9\n   \\]\n   Adding 2 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   n = 9 + 2 = 11\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{11}$.",
