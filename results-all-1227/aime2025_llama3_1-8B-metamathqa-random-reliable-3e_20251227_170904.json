Since $\\angle B = \\angle E = 60^\\circ$, we can draw a circle centered at $A$ with radius $AB = 14$ and a circle centered at $E$ with radius $EA = 26$. The intersection of these two circles will be the points $B$ and $C$. Let's call the coordinates of $B$ and $C$ $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, respectively.\n\nSince $BC = 7$, we can use the distance formula to find the coordinates of $C$:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} &= 7 \\\\\n(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 &= 49\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $CD = 24$, we can use the distance formula again to find the coordinates of $D$:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_3)^2 + (y_2 - y_3)^2} &= 24 \\\\\n(x_2 - x_3)^2 + (y_2 - y_3)^2 &= 576\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $DE = 13$, we can use the distance formula again to find the coordinates of $E$:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(x_3 - x_4)^2 + (y_3 - y_4)^2} &= 13 \\\\\n(x_3 - x_4)^2 + (y_3 - y_4)^2 &= 169\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $EA = 26$, we can use the distance formula again to find the coordinates of $A$:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(x_4 - x_1)^2 + (y_4 - y_1)^2} &= 26 \\\\\n(x_4 - x_1)^2 + (y_4 - y_1)^2 &= 676\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously to find the coordinates of the vertices of the pentagon. However, this is a tedious process and not necessary for this problem. We can simply observe that the coordinates of $B$ and $C$ are symmetric with respect to the $x$-axis, and the coordinates of $D$ and $E$ are symmetric with respect to the $y$-axis. Therefore, the coordinates of $B$ and $C$ are $(x_1, -y_1)$ and $(x_2, -y_2)$, respectively, and the coordinates of $D$ and $E$ are $(-x_3, y_3)$ and $(-x_4, y_4)$, respectively.\n\nNow, let's find the least possible value of $f(X)$. We can rewrite $f(X)$ as $AX + BX + CX + DX + EX$.\n\nSince $AB = 14$, $BC = 7$, $CD = 24$, $DE = 13$, and $EA = 26$, we have:\n\\begin{align*}\nf(X) &= AX + BX + CX + DX + EX \\\\\n&= 14X + (-y_1)X + (-y_2)X + (-x_3)X + (-x_4)X \\\\\n&= (14 - y_1 - y_2 - x_3 - x_4)X\n\\end{align*}\n\nTo minimize $f(X)$, we want to minimize the expression $14 - y_1 - y_2 - x_3 - x_4$. Since $y_1$ and $y_2$ are negative, and $x_3$ and $x_4$ are negative, the minimum value of $f(X)$ occurs when $y_1 = y_2 = x_3 = x_4 = 0$. Therefore, the least possible value of $f(X)$ is $14 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 = 14$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $14 + 0 + 0 = \\boxed{14}$.The answer is: 14",

This can be done in $\\binom{16}{8}$ ways.\nNext, we need to consider the arrangement of the people on the chosen chairs. Since no person can sit next to two other people, each person must be separated by at least one empty chair.\nWe can think of this as arranging the people and empty chairs in a line, with the people alternating with the empty chairs.\nThere are 8 people and 8 empty chairs, so there are 16 positions in total.\nWe can choose 8 of these positions for the people to sit in, which can be done in $\\binom{16}{8}$ ways.\nTherefore, the total number of subsets of 16 chairs that could be selected is $\\binom{16}{8} \\times \\binom{16}{8}$.\nTo find the remainder when this number is divided by 1000, we can calculate the value and take the remainder.\nUsing a calculator, we find that $\\binom{16}{8} \\times \\binom{16}{8} = 1820 \\times 1820 = 330,400$.\nTaking the remainder when 330,400 is divided by 1000, we get $\\boxed{400}$.\nThe answer is: 400",
