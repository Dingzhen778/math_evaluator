value of $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}}$.\nSince $b_i$ is an even number for all $i$, we can rewrite the sum as $\\sum_{i=1}^n 2b_i$.\nWe can also rewrite $n^{\\frac{3}{2}}$ as $(n^2)^{\\frac{3}{4}}$.\nSo, the inequality becomes $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n 2b_i}{(n^2)^{\\frac{3}{4}}} \\geq c$.\nTo find the maximum value of $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n 2b_i}{(n^2)^{\\frac{3}{4}}}$, we can

Since $x$ is not equal to zero, we have $B = 0$.\nFinally, let's move on to the third equation:\n$y_3' = Ay_1 + By_2 + Cy_3$\nSince $y_3$ has an $x^2$ in the second component and zeros in the other components, we can write:\n$y_3' = A(1,0,0) + B(x,0,0) + C(x^2,0,0) = (A,Bx,Cx^2) + (0,0,0) = (A,Bx,Cx^2)$\nSince $y_3$ is a vector with a quadratic dependence on $x$, its derivative is a vector with a quadratic dependence on $x$ as well.
