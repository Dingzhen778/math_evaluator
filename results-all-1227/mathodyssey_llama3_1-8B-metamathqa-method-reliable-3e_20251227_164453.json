Substituting this into the second equation, we get $bc - (c + 2^k) = 2^m$. Simplifying, we have $bc - c = 2^m + 2^k$. Factoring out $c$, we get $c(b - 1) = 2^m + 2^k$.

Since $c$ is a positive integer, $a - 1$ must be a power of 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible values of $a$, $b$, and $c$. Since $a - 1$ and $b - 1$ are powers of 2, $a$ and $b$ must be odd.

      "generated_solution": "We can observe that the sequence $S_n$ is formed by taking the previous sequence and adding the terms together in pairs.\nFor example, $S_2$ is formed by taking $S_1$ and adding the terms together in pairs: $1+1=2$, $2+1=3$.\nSimilarly, $S_3$ is formed by taking $S_2$ and adding the terms together in pairs: $1+2=3$, $2+3=5$, $3+1=4$.\nWe can see that the terms in $S_n$ are the Fibonacci numbers, where the first two terms are 1 and each subsequent term is the sum of the previous two terms.\nTo find the number of terms equal to 1988 in $S_{1988}$, we need to find the index of the Fibonacci number 1988.\nWe can use the formula for the nth Fibonacci number: $F_n = \\frac{\\phi^n - \\phi^{-n}}{\\sqrt{5}}$, where $\\phi = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}$ is the golden ratio.\nUsing this formula, we find that $F_{1988} \\approx 1988.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

      "generated_solution": "To find the UMP test for $H_0: \\theta \\leq \\theta_0$ vs. $H_1: \\theta > \\theta_0$, we need to find a test statistic that has a monotone likelihood ratio.\nThe likelihood function is given by\n\\[L(\\theta) = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\theta}\\right)^n \\prod_{i=1}^n X_i e^{-\\frac{X_i^2}{\\theta}} I(X_i > 0).\\]\nTaking the logarithm of the likelihood function, we have\n\\[\\log L(\\theta) = n \\log \\left(\\frac{2}{\\theta}\\right) + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(-\\frac{X_i^2}{\\theta}\\right) + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log X_i.\\]\nTo find the UMP test, we need to find a test statistic that has a monotone likelihood ratio. Since the likelihood function is a function of $\\theta$, we can use the Neyman-Pearson lemma to find the UMP test.\nThe Neyman-Pearson lemma states that the UMP test is given by rejecting $H_0$ if the likelihood ratio is greater than a constant $k$.\nThe likelihood ratio is given by\n\\[\\frac{L(\\theta_0)}{L(\\theta)} = \\left(\\frac{\\theta_0}{\\theta}\\right)^n \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{\\theta_0} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 - \\frac{1}{\\theta} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2\\right).\\]\nTo find the UMP test, we need to find the value of $k$ such that the likelihood ratio is greater than $k$.\n\\[\\frac{L(\\theta_0)}{L(\\theta)} > k \\Rightarrow \\left(\\frac{\\theta_0}{\\theta}\\right)^n \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{\\theta_0} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 - \\frac{1}{\\theta} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2\\right) > k.\\]\nTaking the logarithm of both sides, we have\n\\[n \\log \\left(\\frac{\\theta_0}{\\theta}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\theta_0} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 - \\frac{1}{\\theta} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 > \\log k.\\]\nSimplifying, we have\n\\[\\frac{1}{\\theta_0} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 - \\frac{1}{\\theta} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 > \\log k - n \\log \\left(\\frac{\\theta_0}{\\theta}\\right).\\]\nMultiplying both sides by $\\theta_0 \\theta$, we have\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_0} - 1\\right) > \\theta_0 \\log k - n \\theta_0 \\log \\left(\\frac{\\theta_0}{\\theta}\\right).\\]\nSince $\\theta > \\theta_0$, we have $\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_0} > 1$, so $\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_0} - 1 > 0$.\nTherefore, the UMP test is given by rejecting $H_0$ if\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 > \\frac{\\theta_0}{2} \\chi_{2n, \\alpha}^2.\\]\nThe answer is: \\frac{\\theta_0}{2}\\chi_{2n,\\alpha}^2",
