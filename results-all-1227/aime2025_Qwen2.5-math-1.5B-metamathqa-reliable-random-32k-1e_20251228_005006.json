$3x-2y=0$.\nLet's consider the case $4x+y=0$.\nSolving for $y$, we get $y=-4x$.\nSince $x$ and $y$ are integers between $-100$ and $100$, inclusive, we can find the number of solutions by counting the number of integer values of $x$ that satisfy the equation.\nFor each value of $x$, there is a corresponding value of $y$ that satisfies the equation.\nTherefore, the number of solutions for the case $4x+y=0$ is equal to the number of integer values of $x$ between $-100$ and $100$, inclusive.\nSimilarly, for the case $3x-2y=0$, we can find the number of solutions by counting the number of integer values of $x$ that satisfy the equation.\nFor each value of $x$, there is a corresponding value of $y$ that satisfies the equation.\nTherefore, the number of solutions for the case $3x-2y=0$ is equal

      "question": "An isosceles trapezoid has an inscribed circle tangent to each of its four sides. The radius of the circle is 3, and the area of the trapezoid is 72. Let the parallel sides of the trapezoid have lengths $r$ and $s$, with $r \\neq s$. Find $r^{2}+s^{2}$.",
      "reference_answer": "504",
      "predicted_answer": "630",
      "generated_solution": "The area of the trapezoid is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}(r+s)h$, where $h$ is the height of the trapezoid. Since the trapezoid has an inscribed circle, the height of the trapezoid is equal to the diameter of the circle, which is $2r = 6$.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the area formula, we have $72 = \\frac{1}{2}(r+s)(6)$. Simplifying, we get $24 = (r+s)(3)$, which implies $r+s = 8$.\n\nWe also know that the radius of the inscribed circle is equal to the distance from the center of the circle to any side of the trapezoid. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the center of the circle is equidistant from the two parallel sides. Therefore, the distance from the center of the circle to each parallel side is equal to the radius of the circle, which is 3.\n\nLet $d$ be the distance from the center of the circle to the shorter parallel side. Then, the distance from the center of the circle to the longer parallel side is $8-d$. Since the distance from the center of the circle to each parallel side is equal to the radius of the circle, we have $d = 3$ and $8-d = 5$.\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of the parallel sides. Let $h$ be the height of the trapezoid. Then, we have $h^2 = (8-d)^2 - (r-s)^2/4$ and $h^2 = d^2 - (r-s)^2/4$.\n\nSubstituting the given values into these equations, we have $h^2 = 5^2 - (r-s)^2/4$ and $h^2 = 3^2 - (r-s)^2/4$. Simplifying, we get $h^2 = 25 - (r-s)^2/4$ and $h^2 = 9 - (r-s)^2/4$.\n\nSince the area of the trapezoid is given by $A = \\frac{1}{2}(r+s)h$, we can substitute the given values into this equation to get $72 = \\frac{1}{2}(8)h$. Simplifying, we get $72 = 4h$, which implies $h = 18$.\n\nSubstituting this value into the equations for $h^2$, we have $18^2 = 25 - (r-s)^2/4$ and $18^2 = 9 - (r-s)^2/4$. Simplifying, we get $324 = 25 - (r-s)^2/4$ and $324 = 9 - (r-s)^2/4$.\n\nSolving these equations for $(r-s)^2$, we have $(r-s)^2 = 4(25-324)) = 4(299) = 1196$ and $(r-s)^2 = 4(9-324)) = 4(315) = 1260$.\n\nSince $(r-s)^2$ must be a non-negative integer, we can conclude that $(r-s)^2 = 1196$.\n\nFinally, we can find $r^2 + s^2$ by using the identity $(r+s)^2 = r^2 + 2rs + s^2$ and the fact that $r+s = 8$ and $(r-s)^2 = 1196$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the identity, we have $8^2 = r^2 + 2rs + s^2$ and $1196 = (r-s)^2 = r^2 - 2rs + s^2$.\n\nAdding these two equations, we get $8^2 + 1196 = 2(r^2 + s^2)$, which implies $r^2 + s^2 = \\frac{8^2 + 1196}{2} = \\frac{64 + 1196}{2} = \\frac{1260}{2} = \\boxed{630}$.\n\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is: 630\nThe answer is:",

      "generated_solution": "The given system of equations can be rewritten as:\n$|25+20i-z|=5$\n$|z-4-k|=|z-3i-k|$\n\nThe first equation represents a circle in the complex plane with center $25+20i$ and radius 5. The second equation represents the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining the points $4+k$ and $3i+k$.\n\nFor the system to have exactly one complex solution, the circle and the perpendicular bisector must intersect at exactly one point. This occurs when the perpendicular bisector is tangent to the circle.\n\nTo find the value of $k$ for which this occurs, we can set up the equation of the perpendicular bisector and solve for $k$.\n\nThe equation of the perpendicular bisector is:\n$z = \\frac{(4+k) + (3i+k)}{2}$\n\nSubstituting this into the equation of the circle, we get:\n$|25+20i - \\frac{(4+k) + (3i+k)}{2}| = 5$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n$|25+20i - \\frac{4+3i+2k}{2}| = 5$\n$|25+20i - \\frac{4+3i}{2} - k| = 5$\n$|25+20i - 2 - \\frac{3i}{2} - k| = 5$\n$|23+20i - \\frac{3i}{2} - k| = 5$\n\nSquaring both sides of this equation, we get:\n$(23+20i - \\frac{3i}{2} - k)(23+20i - \\frac{3i}{2} - k)^* = 25$\n\nExpanding and simplifying this equation, we get:\n$(23+20i - \\frac{3i}{2} - k)(23-20i - \\frac{3i}{2} - k) = 25$\n$(23^2 - (20i - \\frac{3i}{2})^2) - (23(20i - \\frac{3i}{2}) + k(23 - 20i - \\frac{3i}{2}))) = 25$\n$(529 - (400 - 30i + \\frac{9}{4})) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(529 - 391 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (460i - \\frac{69i}{2}) - (23k - 20ik - \\frac{3ik}{2})) = 25$\n$(137 + \\frac{9}{4}) - (4",

      "generated_solution": "The given function $f(x)$ is periodic with period 4. The graph of $f(x)$ has the sawtooth pattern, which means that the function increases linearly from $-1$ to $1$, then decreases linearly from $1$ to $3$, and repeats this pattern every 4 units.\n\nThe parabola $x=34y^2$ intersects the graph of $f(x)$ at finitely many points. To find these intersection points, we need to solve the equation $34y^2 = f(x)$ for $x$ in the interval $[-1,3)$.\n\nFor $x\\in[-1,1)$, we have $f(x)=x$. So, we need to solve the equation $34y^2 = x$ for $x$ in the interval $[-1,1)$. This equation has no real solutions, so there are no intersection points in this interval.\n\nFor $x\\in[1,3)$, we have $f(x)=2-x$. So, we need to solve the equation $34y^2 = 2-x$ for $x$ in the interval $[1,3)$. This equation has two real solutions, which we can find by solving the quadratic equation $34y^2 + x - 2 = 0$ for $x$ in the interval $[1,3)$.\n\nThe solutions to this quadratic equation are $x = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4 \\cdot 34y^2}}{2}$. Since $x$ must be in the interval $[1,3)$, we need to find the values of $y$ for which $1 \\leq \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4 \\cdot 34y^2}}{2} \\leq 3$.\n\nSolving these inequalities, we find that the values of $y$ for which the parabola intersects the graph of $f(x)$ are $y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{34}}$ and $y = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{34}}$.\n\nThe sum of the $y$-coordinates of these intersection points is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{34}} + \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{34}} = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{34}} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{34}}{34} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{34}}{17}$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points can be expressed in the form $\\frac{a+b\\sqrt{c}}{d}$, where $a=0$, $b=2$, $c=34$, and $d=17$. The sum $a+b+c+d$ is $0+2+34+17 = \\boxed{53}$.\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe answer is: 53\nThe",

      "question": "Find the sum of all positive integers $ n $ such that $ n + 2 $ divides the product $ 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) $.",
      "reference_answer": "49",

      "generated_solution": "The given problem is to find the sum of all positive integers $ n $ such that $ n + 2 $ divides the product $ 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) $.\n\nLet's start by simplifying the given expression:\n\\[ 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\]\n\nWe can factor out a 3 from the expression:\n\\[ 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) = 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\]\n\nNow, let's consider the condition that $ n + 2 $ divides the product $ 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) $.\nThis means that when we divide the product by $ n + 2 $, there should be no remainder.\n\nLet's analyze the factors of the product:\n\\[ 3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9) \\]\n\nWe can see that the product has three factors: 3, $ n + 3 $, and $ n^2 + 9 $.\n\nFor $ n + 2 $ to divide the product, it must divide at least one of the factors.\nLet's consider each factor separately:\n\n1. The factor 3: Since 3 is a prime number, it cannot be divided by $ n + 2 $ unless $ n + 2 $ is a multiple of 3.\n2. The factor $ n + 3 $: For $ n + 2 $ to divide $ n + 3 $, $ n + 2 $ must be a factor of $ n + 3 $.\n3. The factor $ n^2 + 9 $: For $ n + 2 $ to divide $ n^2 + 9 $, $ n + 2 $ must be a factor of $ n^2 + 9 $.\n\nLet's analyze each condition:\n\n1. For $ n + 2 $ to divide 3, $ n + 2 $ must be a multiple of 3.\n2. For $ n + 2 $ to divide $ n + 3 $, $ n + 2 $ must be a factor of $ n + 3 $.\n3. For $ n + 2 $ to divide $ n^2 + 9 $, $ n + 2 $ must be a factor of $ n^2 + 9 $.\n\nLet's find the values of $ n $ that satisfy each condition:\n\n1. For $ n + 2 $ to be a multiple of 3, $ n $ must be of the form $ 3k - 2 $, where $ k $ is a positive integer.\n2. For $ n + 2 $ to be a factor of $ n + 3 $, $ n + 2 $ must be equal to $ n + 3 $, which is not possible.\n3. For $ n + 2 $ to be a factor of $ n^2 + 9 $, we need to find the values of $ n $ that satisfy this condition.\n\nLet's analyze the third condition:\n\\[ n + 2 \\text{ divides } n^2 + 9 \\]\n\nWe can rewrite the expression as:\n\\[ n^2 + 9 = (n + 2)(n - 2) + 13 \\]\n\nFor $ n + 2 $ to divide $ n^2 + 9 $, it must divide the remainder, which is 13.\nThis means that $ n + 2 $ must be a factor of 13.\nThe factors of 13 are 1 and 13.\nSo, $ n + 2 $ can be either 1 or 13.\nLet's find the values of $ n $ that satisfy this condition:\n\n1. If $ n + 2 = 1 $, then $ n = -1 $, which is not a positive integer.\n2. If $ n + 2 = 13 $, then $ n = 11 $, which is a positive integer.\n\nSo, the only positive integer $ n $ that satisfies the given condition is $ n = 11 $.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integers $ n $ that satisfy the given condition is $ \\boxed{11} $.\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe answer is: 11\nThe",

We can choose any subset of these 3 multiples of 5 to include in $B$.\n\nTherefore, the number of subsets $B$ that satisfy the property is $2^5 \\cdot 2^3 = 32 \\cdot 8 = 256$.\n\nThe total number of subsets of $A$ is $2^{15}$, since each divisor can either be included or excluded from a subset.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected subset $B$ of $A$ has the property that the least common multiple of its elements is 2025 is $\\frac{256}{2^{15}} = \\frac{256}{32768} = \\frac{1}{128}$.\n\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129\nThe answer is: 129",

      "question": "From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $ N $ cents, where $ N $ is a positive integer. He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.",

1 \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{157}{275} + \\frac{275}{157} - 1 \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{24649 + 75625 - 43725}{43725} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{56549}{43725} \\right) = \\frac{18849}{43725} $.\nWe can continue this process to find more terms of the sequence.\nHowever, we notice that the denominators of the terms are increasing rapidly.\nThis suggests that the sequence may converge to a limit.\nTo find the limit, we assume that the sequence converges to a limit $ L $.\nTaking the limit of both sides of the recursive formula, we have:\n$ L = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( L + \\frac{1}{L} - 1 \\right) $.\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get:\n$ 3L = L + \\frac{1}{L} - 1 $.\nRearranging the terms, we have:\n$ 2L + 1 = \\frac{1}{L} $.\nMultiplying both sides by $ L $, we get:\n$ 2L^2 + L = 1 $.\nRearranging the terms, we have:\n$ 2L^2 + L - 1 = 0 $.\nThis is a quadratic equation in $ L $.\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find that the solutions are:\n$ L = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 8}}{4} = \\frac{-1 \\pm 3}{4} $.\nSo the possible values for $ L $ are $ \\frac{1}{2} $ and $ -1 $.\nHowever, since the terms of the sequence are positive, we can conclude that the limit of the sequence is $ \\frac{1}{2} $.\nTherefore, we have $ x_{2025} = \\frac{1}{2} $.\nExpressing $ \\frac{1}{2} $ as a fraction in lowest terms, we have $ \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} $.\nSo the values of $ m $ and $ n $ are $ m = 1 $ and $ n = 2 $.\nThe remainder when $ m + n = 1 + 2 = 3 $ is divided by 1000 is $ \\boxed{3} $.\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is: 3\nThe answer is",
