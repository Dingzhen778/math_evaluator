      "generated_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the largest value that cannot be obtained using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15 cents. This is a classic problem in number theory, often referred to as the Frobenius coin problem for three coin denominations.\n\nThe Frobenius number for three coin denominations \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) is generally difficult to compute exactly without specific algorithms or computational tools. However, for the specific values given (6, 10, and 15), we can use a more practical approach by checking which values can be formed and identifying the largest value that cannot be formed.\n\nFirst, let's list out some combinations of the coins to see which values we can form:\n\n- Using only 6-cent coins, we can form values like 6, 12, 18, etc.\n- Using only 10-cent coins, we can form values like 10, 20, 30, etc.\n- Using only 15-cent coins, we can form values like 15, 30, 45, etc.\n- Using combinations of these coins, we can form more values. For example, 6 + 10 = 16, 6 + 15 = 21, 10 + 15 = 25, and so on.\n\nTo find the largest value that cannot be formed, we can start by checking the values from 1 up to a reasonable limit. We will use a systematic approach to check each value.\n\nLet's start with the smallest values and work our way up:\n\n- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 cannot be formed.\n- 6 can be formed using one 6-cent coin.\n- 7 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 8 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 9 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 10 can be formed using one 10-cent coin.\n- 11 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 12 can be formed using two 6-cent coins.\n- 13 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 14 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 15 can be formed using one 15-cent coin.\n- 16 can be formed using one 6-cent coin and one 10-cent coin.\n- 17 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 18 can be formed using three 6-cent coins.\n- 19 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 20 can be formed using two 10-cent coins.\n- 21 can be formed using one 6-cent coin and one 15-cent coin.\n- 22 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 23 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 24 can be formed using four 6-cent coins.\n- 25 can be formed using one 10-cent coin and one 15-cent coin.\n- 26 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 27 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 28 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 29 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 30 can be formed using three 10-cent coins.\n- 31 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 32 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 33 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 34 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 35 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 36 can be formed using six 6-cent coins.\n- 37 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 38 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 39 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 40 can be formed using four 10-cent coins.\n- 41 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 42 can be formed using seven 6-cent coins.\n- 43 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 44 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 45 can be formed using three 15-cent coins.\n- 46 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 47 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 48 can be formed using eight 6-cent coins.\n- 49 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 50 can be formed using five 10-cent coins.\n- 51 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 52 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 53 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 54 can be formed using nine 6-cent coins.\n- 55 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 56 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 57 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 58 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 59 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 60 can be formed using ten 6-cent coins.\n- 61 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 62 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 63 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 64 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 65 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 66 can be formed using eleven 6-cent coins.\n- 67 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 68 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 69 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 70 can be formed using thirteen 6-cent coins.\n- 71 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 72 can be formed using twelve 6-cent coins.\n- 73 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 74 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 75 can be formed using fifteen 6-cent coins.\n- 76 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 77 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 78 can be formed using thirteen 6-cent coins.\n- 79 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 80 can be formed using twenty 6-cent coins.\n- 81 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 82 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 83 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 15.\n- 84 can be formed using fourteen 6-cent coins.\n- 85 cannot be formed using the coins of values 6, 10, and 1",
