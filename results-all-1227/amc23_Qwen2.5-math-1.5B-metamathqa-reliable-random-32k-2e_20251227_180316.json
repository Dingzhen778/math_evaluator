      "question": "Cities $A$ and $B$ are $45$ miles apart. Alicia lives in $A$ and Beth lives in $B$. Alicia bikes towards $B$ at 18 miles per hour. Leaving at the same time, Beth bikes toward $A$ at 12 miles per hour. How many miles from City $A$ will they be when they meet?",
      "reference_answer": "27",
      "predicted_answer": "27",
      "generated_solution": "1. Alicia and Beth are biking towards each other, so their combined speed is 18 + 12 = 30 miles per hour.\n  2. The distance between City $A$ and City $B$ is 45 miles.\n  3. To find the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.\n  4. Plugging in the values, we get: time = 45 miles / 30 miles per hour = 1.5 hours.\n  5. To find the distance from City $A$ where they meet, we can use the formula: distance = speed * time.\n  6. Plugging in the values, we get: distance = 18 miles per hour * 1.5 hours = 27 miles.\n  7. Therefore, Alicia and Beth will be 27 miles from City $A$ when they meet.\n  8.

We can rewrite this equation as $x^2-2xy-3y^2=0$.\n  4. Factoring, we have $(x-3y)(x+y)=0$.\n  5. Since $x$ and $y$ are positive real numbers, we know that $x+y$ cannot be zero.\n  6. Therefore, we must have $x-3y=0$.\n  7. Substituting this into the equation $y^3=x^2$, we have $y^3=(3y)^2$.\n  8. Simplifying, we have $y^3=9y^2$.\n  9.

      "question": "How many complex numbers satisfy the equation $z^5=\\overline{z}$, where $\\overline{z}$ is the conjugate of the complex number $z$?",
      "reference_answer": "7",
      "predicted_answer": "4",
      "generated_solution": "1. Let $z = a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit.\n  2. Then $\\overline{z} = a - bi$.\n  3. Substituting these expressions into the given equation, we have $(a + bi)^5 = a - bi$.\n  4. Expanding the left side using the binomial theorem, we get $a^5 + 5a^4bi - 10a^3b^2 - 10a^2b^3i + 5ab^4 + b^5i = a - bi$.\n  5. Equating the real and imaginary parts, we have the following system of equations:\n    * $a^5 - 10a^3b^2 + 5ab^4 = a$\n    * $5a^4b - 10a^2b^3 + b^5 = -b$\n  6. Simplifying the second equation, we get $5a^4b - 10a^2b^3 + b^5 + b = 0$.\n  7. Factoring out $b$, we have $b(5a^4 - 10a^2b^2 + b^4 + 1) = 0$.\n  8. Since $b$ cannot be zero (otherwise $z$ would be real), we must have $5a^4 - 10a^2b^2 + b^4 + 1 = 0$.\n  9. Rearranging the terms, we get $b^4 - 10a^2b^2 + 5a^4 + 1 = 0$.\n  10. This is a quartic equation in $b^2$. Let $x = b^2$. Then the equation becomes $x^2 - 10a^2x + 5a^4 + 1 = 0$.\n  11. Using the quadratic formula, we find that the solutions for $x$ are $x = \\frac{10a^2 \\pm \\sqrt{100a^4 - 4(5a^4 + 1))}}{2}$.\n  12. Simplifying the expression under the square root, we get $100a^4 - 4(5a^4 + 1)) = 100a^4 - 20a^4 - 4 = 80a^4 - 4$.\n  13. Therefore, the solutions for $x$ are $x = \\frac{10a^2 \\pm \\sqrt{80a^4 - 4}}{2}$.\n  14. Since $x = b^2$ must be nonnegative, we must have $10a^2 \\pm \\sqrt{80a^4 - 4}} \\ge 0$.\n  15. Solving this inequality, we find that $a$ must satisfy $a^2 \\ge \\frac{1}{20}$.\n  16. Therefore, the possible values for $a$ are $a = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{20}}$.\n  17. Substituting these values of $a$ into the equation $x = \\frac{10a^2 \\pm \\sqrt{80a^4 - 4}}{2}$, we find that the corresponding values of $x$ are $x = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $x = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n  18. Therefore, the possible values for $b^2$ are $b^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n  19. Taking the square root of both sides, we find that the possible values for $b$ are $b = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n  20. Therefore, the possible values for $z$ are $z = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}i$.\n  21. Since there are 4 possible values for $z$, the answer is $\\boxed{4}$.\n  22.

      "generated_solution": "1. We start by considering the given equation $|1+z+z^{2}|=4$.\n  2. We can rewrite the equation as $|z^2+z+1|=4$.\n  3. Let $z=x+yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.\n  4. Substituting $z=x+yi$ into the equation, we get $|(x+yi)^2+(x+yi)+1|=4$.\n  5. Expanding and simplifying, we have $|x^2-y^2+2xyi+x+yi+1|=4$.\n  6. Combining like terms, we get $|x^2-y^2+x+1+(2xy+y)i|=4$.\n  7. Since the magnitude of a complex number is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of its real and imaginary parts, we have $\\sqrt{(x^2-y^2+x+1)^2+(2xy+y)^2}}=4$.\n  8. Squaring both sides of the equation, we get $(x^2-y^2+x+1)^2+(2xy+y)^2=16$.\n  9. Expanding and simplifying, we have $x^4-2x^2y^2+y^4+2x^3+2xy^2+2x^2+2x+1+4x^2y^2+4xy^3+4x^2y+4xy+y^2=16$.\n  10. Combining like terms, we get $x^4+2x^3+3x^2+2x+1+2x^2y^2+4xy^3+4x^2y+4xy+y^2=16$.\n  11. Rearranging the terms, we have $x^4+2x^3+3x^2+2x+1+2x^2y^2+4xy^3+4x^2y+4xy+y^2-16=0$.\n  12. Factoring the equation, we get $(x^2+xy+y^2-4)(x^2-xy+y^2+4)=0$.\n  13. Since $x^2+xy+y^2-4$ and $x^2-xy+y^2+4$ are both quadratic equations in $x$ and $y$, we can solve them separately.\n  14. For the equation $x^2+xy+y^2-4=0$, we can rewrite it as $(x+y)^2-2xy-4=0$.\n  15. Let $u=x+y$ and $v=xy$. Then the equation becomes $u^2-2v-4=0$.\n  16. Solving for $v$, we get $v=\\frac{u^2-4}{2}$.\n  17. Substituting $v=\\frac{u^2-4}{2}$ into the equation $x^2-xy+y^2+4=0$, we get $x^2-xy+y^2+4=0$.\n  18. Solving for $x$ and $y$, we get $x=\\frac{u\\pm\\sqrt{u^2-4(u^2-4))}}{2}$ and $y=\\frac{u\\mp\\sqrt{u^2-4(u^2-4))}}{2}$.\n  19. Simplifying, we get $x=\\frac{u\\pm\\sqrt{-3u^2+16}}{2}$ and $y=\\frac{u\\mp\\sqrt{-3u^2+16}}{2}$.\n  20. Since $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, we must have $-3u^2+16\\geq0$.\n  21. Solving for $u$, we get $u^2\\leq\\frac{16}{3}$.\n  22. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $|u|\\leq\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n  23. Since $u=x+y$, we have $|x+y|\\leq\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n  24. The maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$ occurs when $x=0$ and $y=\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n  25.

      "generated_solution": "1. Let $a = \\log_{7x}2023$, $b = \\log_{289x}2023$, and $c = \\log_{2023x}2023$.\n  2. We can rewrite the given equation as $ab = c$.\n  3. Using the change of base formula, we can rewrite $a$, $b$, and $c$ as follows:\n    * $a = \\frac{\\log 2023}{\\log 7x}$\n    * $b = \\frac{\\log 2023}{\\log 289x}$\n    * $c = \\frac{\\log 2023}{\\log 2023x}$\n  4.

Simplifying this equation, we find that $\\log 2023 = \\log 7x + \\log 289x + \\log 2023x$.\n  6. Using the properties of logarithms, we can rewrite this equation as $\\log 2023 = \\log (7x \\cdot 289x \\cdot 2023x)$.\n  7. Simplifying further, we get $\\log 2023 = \\log (7 \\cdot 289 \\cdot 2023 \\cdot x^3)$.\n  8. Since the logarithm function is one-to-one, we can conclude that $2023 = 7 \\cdot 289 \\cdot 2023 \\cdot x^3$.\n  9. Dividing both sides of this equation by $7 \\cdot 289 \\cdot 2023$, we find that $x^3 = \\frac{1}{7 \\cdot 289 \\cdot 2023}}$.\n  10. Taking the cube root of both sides of this equation, we get $x = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{7 \\cdot 289 \\cdot 2023}}}$.\n  11. Substituting this value of $x$ into the original equation, we find that the product of all solutions is $\\boxed{1}$.\n  12. The answer is: 1 12. The answer is: 1 12. The answer is: 1 12.

Dividing both sides by 4, we have:\n  \\[(1+2a)(1+b)(2a+b)) = 8ab.\\]\n  4. Now, we can use the fact that $a$ and $b$ are positive real numbers to simplify further. Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, we know that $1+2a > 1$, $1+b > 1$, and $2a+b > 0$. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:\n  \\[(1+2a)(1+b)(2a+b)) = 8ab.\\]\n  5.

Factoring out $4ab$, we get:\n  \\[4ab(a + b + ab - 1) = 0.\\]\n  10. Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, we know that $4ab \\neq 0$. Therefore, we must have:\n  \\[a + b + ab - 1 = 0.\\]\n  11. Rearranging, we have:\n  \\[ab + a + b = 1.\\]\n  12. Now, we can use the fact that $a$ and $b$ are positive real numbers to find the possible values of $a$ and $b$. Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, we know that $ab > 0$, $a > 0$, and $b > 0$. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:\n  \\[ab + a + b = 1.\\]\n  13. To find the possible values of $a$ and $b$, we can use the fact that $ab + a + b = 1$ is a quadratic equation in terms of $a$ and $b$. We can rewrite the equation as:\n  \\[ab + a + b - 1 = 0.\\]\n  14. Factoring, we have:\n  \\[(a + 1)(b + 1) = 2.\\]\n  15. Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, we know that $a + 1 > 1$ and $b + 1 > 1$. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:\n  \\[(a + 1)(b + 1) = 2.\\]\n  16. To find the possible values of $a$ and $b$, we can use the fact that $(a + 1)(b + 1) = 2$ is a quadratic equation in terms of $a$ and $b$. We can rewrite the equation as:\n  \\[(a + 1)(b + 1) = 2.\\]\n  17. Expanding, we have:\n  \\[ab + a + b + 1 = 2.\\]\n  18. Simplifying, we get:\n  \\[ab + a + b = 1.\\]\n  19. Now, we can use the fact that $ab + a + b = 1$ is a quadratic equation in terms of $a$ and $b$. We can rewrite the equation as:\n  \\[ab + a + b = 1.\\]\n  20.

We can rewrite $15^5$ as $(3 \\cdot 5)^5 = 3^5 \\cdot 5^5$.\n  4. Now, we can rewrite the expression as $2^{15} \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^5$.\n  5. We can combine the powers of 2 and 5 as $2^{15} \\cdot 5^{15} \\cdot 3^5$.\n  6. We can rewrite $2^{15} \\cdot 5^{15}$ as $(2 \\cdot 5)^{15} = 10^{15}$.\n  7. Now, we can rewrite the expression as $10^{15} \\cdot 3^5$.\n  8. We can calculate $10^{15}$ as $1000000000000000$.\n  9. We can calculate $3^5$ as $243$.\n  10. Now, we can multiply $1000000000000000$ and $243$ to get $243000000000000000$.\n  11. We can count the number of digits in $243000000000000000$ as $\\boxed{20}$.\n  12.

      "question": "Calculate the maximum area of an isosceles trapezoid that has legs of length $1$ and one base twice as long as the other. The final answer can be written in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m^2+n^2$?",
      "reference_answer": "13",
      "predicted_answer": "37",
      "generated_solution": "1. Let the length of the shorter base be $x$. Then the length of the longer base is $2x$.\n  2. The height of the trapezoid can be found using the Pythagorean Theorem. Let $h$ be the height. Then $h^2 + \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2 = 1^2$.\n  3. Simplifying the equation, we get $h^2 + \\frac{x^2}{4}} = 1$.\n  4. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 4, we get $4h^2 + x^2 = 4$.\n  5. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the height is also the perpendicular distance from the longer base to the shorter base. Therefore, the area of the trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2}(x + 2x)h = \\frac{3}{2}xh$.\n  6. Substituting the value of $h$ from step 3, we get the area as $\\frac{3}{2}x\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{x^2}{4}}$.\n  7. To find the maximum area, we need to find the value of $x$ that maximizes the expression $\\frac{3}{2}x\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{x^2}{4}}$.\n  8. Taking the derivative of the expression with respect to $x$ and setting it equal to 0, we get $\\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{x^2}{4}}} - \\frac{3}{2}x\\frac{x}{4\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{x^2}{4}}}}} = 0$.\n  9. Simplifying the equation, we get $1 - \\frac{x^2}{4}} = \\frac{x^2}{4}}$.\n  10. Solving for $x$, we get $x = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3}$.\n  11. Substituting the value of $x$ back into the expression for the area, we get the maximum area as $\\frac{3}{2}\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\right)\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\right)}{4}}}} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}$.\n  12. Therefore, the maximum area of the isosceles trapezoid is $\\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}$.\n  13. To find $m^2 + n^2$, we need to find the values of $m$ and $n$.\n  14. Since the answer must be an integer from 0 to 999, we can multiply the maximum area by 3 to get an integer value.\n  15. Multiplying $\\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}}$ by 3, we get $4\\sqrt{2}$.\n  16. Since $4\\sqrt{2}$ is not an integer, we can round it to the nearest integer, which is 6.\n  17. Therefore, $m = 6$ and $n = 1$.\n  18. Finally, we can calculate $m^2 + n^2$ as $6^2 + 1^2 = 36 + 1 = \\boxed{37}$.\n  19. The answer is: 37  19\n  20. The answer is: 37  20\n  21. The answer is: 37  21\n  22. The answer is: 37  22\n  23.

      "question": "When $n$ standard six-sided dice are rolled, the product of the numbers rolled can be any of $936$ possible values. What is $n$?",
      "reference_answer": "11",
      "predicted_answer": "6",
      "generated_solution": "1. We know that the product of the numbers rolled can be any of 936 possible values.\n  2. We can start by finding the prime factorization of 936: $936 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 13$.\n  3. Each die has six faces, so the product of the numbers rolled can be any of the numbers that can be formed by multiplying the numbers on the faces of the dice.\n  4. Since each die has six faces, the product of the numbers rolled can be any of the numbers that can be formed by multiplying the numbers on the faces of the dice.\n  5. We can start by finding the prime factorization of the numbers that can be formed by multiplying the numbers on the faces of the dice.\n  6. We can then compare the prime factorization of 936 with the prime factorization of the numbers that can be formed by multiplying the numbers on the faces of the dice.\n  7. We can see that the prime factorization of 936 matches the prime factorization of the numbers that can be formed by multiplying the numbers on the faces of the dice.\n  8. Therefore, the product of the numbers rolled can be any of the numbers that can be formed by multiplying the numbers on the faces of the dice.\n  9. Since each die has six faces, the product of the numbers rolled can be any of the numbers that can be formed by multiplying the numbers on the faces of the dice.\n  10. We can conclude that $n = \\boxed{6}$.\n  11.

      "predicted_answer": "1625",
      "generated_solution": "1. Convert the width of the strip from millimeters to centimeters: $6.5$ mm = $0.65$ cm.\n  2. Convert the length of the strip from meters to centimeters: $25$ m = $2500$ cm.\n  3. Calculate the area of the strip in square centimeters: $0.65$ cm $\\times$ $2500$ cm = $1625$ square centimeters.\n  4. Since the answer must be an integer from 0 to 999, we round $1625$ to the nearest integer, which is $1625$.\n  5. Therefore, Jackson could cover $\\boxed{1625}$ square centimeters of paper with paint.\n  6.

Therefore, there are $\\boxed{100}$ integers $n$ for which the given expression represents a real number.\nThe answer is: 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100",
