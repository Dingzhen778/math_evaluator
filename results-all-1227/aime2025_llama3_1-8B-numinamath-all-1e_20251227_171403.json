The critical points occur where the derivative \\( f'(x) \\) is zero or undefined. The critical points are:\n   \\[\n   x = 18, \\quad x = 72, \\quad x = 98, \\quad x = k\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the behavior of \\( f(x) \\) at these points:**\n   - At \\( x = 18 \\), \\( f(x) \\) is undefined.\n   - At \\( x = 72 \\), \\( f(x) \\) is undefined.\n   - At \\( x = 98 \\), \\( f(x) \\) is undefined.\n   - At \\( x = k \\), \\( f(x) \\) is undefined.\n\n5. **Analyze the behavior of \\( f(x) \\) between the critical points:**\n   - For \\( x \\in (0, 18) \\cup (72, 98) \\cup (k, \\infty) \\), \\( f(x) \\) is positive.\n   - For \\( x \\in (18, 72) \\cup (98, k) \\), \\( f(x) \\) is negative.\n\n6. **Determine the minimum value of \\( f(x) \\):**\n   The minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) occurs at the points where \\( f(x) \\) changes sign, which are \\( x = 18 \\), \\( x = 72 \\), and \\( x = 98 \\).\n\n7. **Calculate the sum of the values of \\( k \\):**\n   Since \\( f(x) \\) achieves its minimum value at exactly two positive real numbers \\( x \\), we need to find the value of \\( k \\) such that the function has a minimum at these points. The sum of the values of \\( k \\) is:\n   \\[\n   k = 18 + 72 + 98 = 188\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{188}\\)",
