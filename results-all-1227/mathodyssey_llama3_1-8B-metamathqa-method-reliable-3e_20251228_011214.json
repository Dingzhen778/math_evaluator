Since $a^2$ and $cg$ are both positive, $bd$ must be positive. Therefore, $b$ and $d$ must have the same sign. Similarly, $a$ and $c$ must have the same sign, and $e$ and $f$ must have the same sign.\nFrom the second equation, we have $ab + be + cf = 7$. Since $ab$ and $cf$ are both positive, $be$ must be positive. Therefore, $b$ and $e$ must have the same sign. Similarly, $a$ and $c$ must have the same sign, and $b$ and $f$ must have the same sign.\nFrom the third equation, we have $ac + bg + ci = 7$. Since $ac$ and $ci$ are both positive, $bg$ must be positive. Therefore, $b$ and $g$ must have the same sign. Similarly, $a$ and $c$ must have the same sign, and $g$ and $i$ must have the same sign.\nFrom the fourth equation, we have $ad + ed + fg = 7$. Since $ad$ and $fg$ are both positive, $ed$ must be positive. Therefore, $e$ and $d$ must have the same sign. Similarly, $a$ and $f$ must have the same sign, and $d$ and $g$ must have the same sign.\nFrom the fifth equation, we have $bd + ee + fh = 11$. Since $bd$ and $fh$ are both positive, $ee$ must be positive. Therefore, $e$ and $e$ must have the same sign. Similarly, $b$ and $f$ must have the same sign, and $d$ and $h$ must have the same sign.\nFrom the sixth equation, we have $bf + eg + hi = 7$.

Similarly, $b$ and $f$ must have the same sign, and $h$ and $i$ must have the same sign.\nFrom the seventh equation, we have $ag + eh + gi = 7$. Since $ag$ and $gi$ are both positive, $eh$ must be positive. Therefore, $e$ and $h$ must have the same sign. Similarly, $a$ and $g$ must have the same sign, and $h$ and $i$ must have the same sign.\nFrom the eighth equation, we have $bg + eh + hi = 7$. Since $bg$ and $hi$ are both positive, $eh$ must be positive. Therefore, $e$ and $h$ must have the same sign. Similarly, $b$ and $g$ must have the same sign, and $h$ and $i$ must have the same sign.\nFrom the ninth equation, we have $cg + fh + ii = 11$. Since $cg$ and $ii$ are both positive, $fh$ must be positive. Therefore, $f$ and $h$ must have the same sign.
