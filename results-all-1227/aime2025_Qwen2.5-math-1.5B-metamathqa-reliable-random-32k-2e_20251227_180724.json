      "generated_solution": "17_b = 1b + 7\n  97_b = 9b + 7\n  We want to find the values of $b$ for which $17_b$ divides $97_b$.\n  We can set up the equation $97_b = k(17_b)$, where $k$ is an integer.\n  Substituting the expressions for $17_b$ and $97_b$, we get $9b + 7 = k(1b + 7)$.\n  Expanding and rearranging, we have $9b + 7 = kb + 7k$.\n  Simplifying, we get $9b - kb = 7k - 7$.\n  Factoring out $b$ and $k$, we have $b(9 - k) = 7(k - 1)$.\n  Since $b > 9$, we know that $9 - k$ must be positive.\n  Therefore, $k$ must be less than 9.\n  We can now test values of $k$ from 1 to 8 to find the corresponding values of $b$.\n  For $k = 1$, we have $b(9 - 1) = 7(1 - 1)$, which simplifies to $8b = 0$.\n  Since $b > 9$, this equation has no solutions.\n  For $k = 2$, we have $b(9 - 2) = 7(2 - 1)$, which simplifies to $7b = 7$.\n  Dividing both sides by 7, we get $b = 1$.\n  However, $b$ must be greater than 9, so this equation has no solutions.\n  For $k = 3$, we have $b(9 - 3) = 7(3 - 1)$, which simplifies to $6b = 14$.\n  Dividing both sides by 6, we get $b = \\frac{7}{3}$.\n  However, $b$ must be an integer, so this equation has no solutions.\n  For $k = 4$, we have $b(9 - 4) = 7(4 - 1)$, which simplifies to $5b = 21$.\n  Dividing both sides by 5, we get $b = \\frac{21}{5}$.\n  However, $b$ must be an integer, so this equation has no solutions.\n  For $k = 5$, we have $b(9 - 5) = 7(5 - 1)$, which simplifies to $4b = 28$.\n  Dividing both sides by 4, we get $b = 7$.\n  Since $b > 9$, this equation has no solutions.\n  For $k = 6$, we have $b(9 - 6) = 7(6 - 1)$, which simplifies to $3b = 35$.\n  Dividing both sides by 3, we get $b = \\frac{35}{3}$.\n  However, $b$ must be an integer, so this equation has no solutions.\n  For $k = 7$, we have $b(9 - 7) = 7(7 - 1)$, which simplifies to $2b = 42$.\n  Dividing both sides by 2, we get $b = 21$.\n  Since $b > 9$, this equation has a solution.\n  For $k = 8$, we have $b(9 - 8) = 7(8 - 1)$, which simplifies to $b = 49$.\n  Since $b > 9$, this equation has a solution.\n  Therefore, the values of $b$ for which $17_b$ divides $97_b$ are $b = 21$ and $b = 49$.\n  The sum of these values is $21 + 49 = \\boxed{70}$.\n  The answer is: 70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70  70",

      "generated_solution": "The given function $f(x)$ is periodic with period 4. The graph of $f(x)$ has the sawtooth pattern, which means that the function increases linearly from $-1$ to $1$, then decreases linearly from $1$ to $3$, and repeats this pattern every 4 units.\n\nThe parabola $x=34y^2$ intersects the graph of $f(x)$ at finitely many points. To find these intersection points, we need to solve the equation $34y^2 = f(x)$ for $x$ and $y$.\n\nSince $f(x)$ is periodic with period 4, we can restrict our attention to the interval $[-1,3)$, where the function has the sawtooth pattern. Within this interval, the function $f(x)$ is defined as follows:\n\n$f(x) = \\begin{cases} x & \\text{if } x \\in [-1,1) \\\\ 2-x & \\text{if } x \\in [1,3) \\end{cases}$\n\nWe can now solve the equation $34y^2 = f(x)$ for $x$ and $y$ in the interval $[-1,3)$.\n\nFor $x \\in [-1,1)$, we have $34y^2 = x$. Solving for $y$, we get $y = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{34}}$.\n\nFor $x \\in [1,3)$, we have $34y^2 = 2-x$. Solving for $y$, we get $y = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{2-x}{34}}$.\n\nTo find the intersection points, we need to find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy both equations. We can do this by setting the two expressions for $y$ equal to each other and solving for $x$.\n\nSetting $\\sqrt{\\frac{x}{34}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2-x}{34}}$, we get $\\frac{x}{34} = \\frac{2-x}{34}$.\n\nSimplifying, we get $x = 2-x$.\n\nSolving for $x$, we get $x = 1$.\n\nSubstituting this value of $x$ back into either of the expressions for $y$, we get $y = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{34}}} = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{34}}$.\n\nTherefore, the intersection points are $(1, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{34}}})$ and $(1, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{34}}})$.\n\nThe sum of the $y$-coordinates of these intersection points is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{34}}} + (-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{34}}}) = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{0}$.\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is: 0\nThe answer is",

      "generated_solution": "The given problem involves finding the area of a finite region formed by the intersection of a plane and a set of inequalities. To solve this problem, we need to determine the boundaries of the region and then calculate its area.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the inequalities in a more convenient form:\n$x-yz<y-zx<z-xy$\n\nWe can rewrite these inequalities as:\n$x-yz-y+zx<0$\n$y-zx-z+xy<0$\n$z-xy-x+y<0$\n\nNow, let's consider the plane $x+y+z=75$. We can rewrite this equation as:\n$z=75-x-y$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $z$ into the inequalities, we get:\n$x-y(75-x-y))<y-(75-x-y)x$\n$y-(75-x-y)x-(75-x-y)y<0$\n$75-x-y-(75-x-y)x-(75-x-y)y<0$\n\nSimplifying these inequalities, we get:\n$x-y(75-x-y))<y-(75-x-y)x$\n$y-(75-x-y)x-(75-x-y)y<0$\n$75-x-y-(75-x-y)x-(75-x-y)y<0$\n\nNow, let's consider the boundaries of the region formed by the intersection of the plane and the set of inequalities. The boundaries are determined by the equations obtained by setting each inequality to zero.\n\nFor the first inequality, we have:\n$x-y(75-x-y))=0$\n\nFor the second inequality, we have:\n$y-(75-x-y)x)=0$\n\nFor the third inequality, we have:\n$75-x-y-(75-x-y)x-(75-x-y)y)=0$\n\nSolving these equations, we find that the boundaries of the region are determined by the following equations:\n$x-y(75-x-y))=0$\n$y-(75-x-y)x)=0$\n$75-x-y-(75-x-y)x-(75-x-y)y)=0$\n\nTo find the area of the finite region, we need to determine the intersection of these boundaries.

The probability of this line segment intersecting with the existing line segments is 2/4 = 1/2.\n  9. We can continue this process for each line segment drawn, calculating the probability of intersecting with the existing line segments.\n  10. To find the expected number of regions, we need to sum the probabilities of each line segment intersecting with the existing line segments.\n  11. The expected number of regions is the sum of the probabilities of each line segment intersecting with the existing line segments.\n  12. The expected number of regions is 27 * (1/2) = 13.5.\n  13. Since the answer must be an integer from 0 to 999, we round the expected number of regions to the nearest integer.\n  14. The expected number of regions is 14.\n  15. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{14}.\n  16.

The number of subsets $B$ that contain at least one divisor of 3 is $2^5 - 1 = 31$, and the number of subsets $B$ that contain at least one divisor of 5 is $2^3 - 1 = 7$.\n\nTherefore, the number of subsets $B$ that satisfy the given property is $31 \\cdot 7 = 217$.\n\nThe total number of subsets of $A$ is $2^{15} = 32768$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected subset $B$ of $A$ has the property that the least common multiple of its elements is 2025 is $\\frac{217}{32768}$.\n\nSimplifying this fraction, we get $\\frac{217}{32768} = \\frac{217}{2^{15}} = \\frac{217}{2^{15}} \\cdot \\frac{2^{15}}{2^{15}}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{15} \\cdot 2^{15}}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{2^{30}} = \\frac{217 \\cdot 2^{15}}{",

      "question": "From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $ N $ cents, where $ N $ is a positive integer. He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.",

      "generated_solution": "1. We need to find the number of subsets of 16 chairs that could be selected.\n  2. Since no person can sit next to two other people, we can think of the chairs as being arranged in a row with gaps between them.\n  3. We can represent the gaps between the chairs as 16 - 8 = 8 gaps.\n  4. We can think of the gaps as being filled with either a person or an empty chair.\n  5. Since we have 8 gaps and 8 people, we can think of this as a problem of distributing 8 identical objects (the gaps) into 8 distinct boxes (the people).\n  6. The number of ways to distribute 8 identical objects into 8 distinct boxes is given by the formula $\\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1}$, where $n$ is the number of objects and $k$ is the number of boxes.\n  7. In this case, $n = 8$ and $k = 8$, so the number of ways to distribute the gaps is $\\binom{8 + 8 - 1}{8 - 1}} = \\binom{15}{7}$.\n  8. We can calculate $\\binom{15}{7}$ using the formula $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}}$.\n  9. Plugging in the values, we get $\\binom{15}{7} = \\frac{15!}{7!(15-7)!}} = \\frac{15!}{7!8!}$.\n  10.

Therefore, the number of subsets of 16 chairs that could be selected is $N = 6435$.\n  12. To find the remainder when $N$ is divided by 1000, we can use the modulo operation.\n  13. Calculating $6435 \\mod 1000$, we get $6435 \\mod 1000 = 435$.\n  14. Therefore, the remainder when $N$ is divided by 1000 is $\\boxed{435}$.\n  15. The answer is: 435  16. The answer is: 435  17.

      "question": "Let $ S $ be the set of vertices of a regular 24-gon. Find the number of ways to draw 12 segments of equal lengths so that each vertex in $ S $ is an endpoint of exactly one of the 12 segments.",

      "generated_solution": "1. We can start by considering the number of ways to draw 12 segments of equal lengths from the 24 vertices of the regular 24-gon.\n  2. Since each vertex must be an endpoint of exactly one of the 12 segments, we can think of this as a permutation problem.\n  3. The number of ways to arrange 12 segments among 24 vertices is given by the formula $\\frac{24!}{(24-12)! \\cdot 12!}}$.\n  4. Simplifying this expression, we get $\\frac{24!}{12! \\cdot 12!}}$.\n  5. Using a calculator or computer, we can evaluate this expression to find that the number of ways to draw 12 segments of equal lengths is 2,704,156.\n  6. Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{2704156}$.\n  7.
