Since Alicia bikes at a speed of 18 miles per hour and Beth bikes at a speed of 12 miles per hour, the distance they will have traveled is $18t$ and $12t$ respectively. Since they are 45 miles apart, we have the equation $18t + 12t = 45$. Simplifying, we get $30t = 45$, so $t = \\frac{45}{30} = 1.5$.
