Bob splits the boxes into two groups, and Alice adds one pebble to each box in one group and removes one pebble from each box in the other group. Since Alice has already ensured that there is at least one pebble in each box, she can maintain this condition by adding one pebble to each box in the group she chooses and removing one pebble from each box in the other group.\nThis process continues for each subsequent round. Alice can maintain the condition that there is at least one pebble in each box by adding one pebble to each box in the group she chooses and removing one pebble from each box in the other group.\nTherefore, Alice can prevent Bob from winning as long as there is at least one pebble in each box at the end of each round.\nThe smallest $n$ that satisfies this condition is $\\boxed{60}$.\nThe answer is: 60",

      "generated_solution": "We can rewrite the given equation as $f(xf(x)) = f(y) + x^2$.\nLet's substitute $x = 0$ into the equation:\n$f(0f(0)) = f(y) + 0^2$\n$f(0) = f(y)$\nSo, $f(0)$ is a constant function.\n\nNow, let's substitute $x = 1$ into the equation:\n$f(f(1)) = f(y) + 1^2$\n$f(f(1)) = f(y) + 1$\n\nSince $f(0)$ is a constant function, we can substitute $f(0)$ into the equation:\n$f(f(1)) = f(0) + 1$\n\nSince $f(0)$ is a constant function, we can substitute $f(0)$ into the equation again:\n$f(f(1)) = f(0) + 1 = f(0) + 1$\n\nTherefore, $f(1) = 1$.\n\nNow, let's substitute $x = 2$ into the equation:\n$f(2f(2)) = f(y) + 2^2$\n$f(4) = f(y) + 4$\n\nSince $f(1) = 1$, we can substitute $f(1)$ into the equation:\n$f(4) = f(y) + 4 = f(y) + 4$\n\nTherefore, $f(4) = 4$.\n\nNow, let's substitute $x = 3$ into the equation:\n$f(3f(3)) = f(y) + 3^2$\n$f(9) = f(y) + 9$\n\nSince $f(1) = 1$, we can substitute $f(1)$ into the equation:\n$f(9) = f(y) + 9 = f(y) + 9$\n\nTherefore, $f(9) = 9$.\n\nNow, let's substitute $x = 4$ into the equation:\n$f(4f(4)) = f(y) + 4^2$\n$f(16) = f(y) + 16$\n\nSince $f(4) = 4$, we can substitute $f(4)$ into the equation:\n$f(16) = f(y) + 16 = f(y) + 16$\n\nTherefore, $f(16) = 16$.\n\nNow, let's substitute $x = 5$ into the equation:\n$f(5f(5)) = f(y) + 5^2$\n$f(25) = f(y) + 25$\n\nSince $f(1) = 1$, we can substitute $f(1)$ into the equation:\n$f(25) = f(y) + 25 = f(y) + 25$\n\nTherefore, $f(25) = 25$.\n\nNow, let's substitute $x = 6$ into the equation:\n$f(6f(6)) = f(y) + 6^2$\n$f(36) = f(y) + 36$\n\nSince $f(4) = 4$, we can substitute $f(4)$ into the equation:\n$f(36) = f(y) + 36 = f(y) + 36$\n\nTherefore, $f(36) = 36$.\n\nNow, let's substitute $x = 7$ into the equation:\n$f(7f(7)) = f(y) + 7^2$\n$f(49) = f(y) + 49$\n\nSince $f(1) = 1$, we can substitute $f(1)$ into the equation:\n$f(49) = f(y) + 49 = f(y) + 49$\n\nTherefore, $f(49) = 49$.\n\nNow, let's substitute $x = 8$ into the equation:\n$f(8f(8)) = f(y) + 8^2$\n$f(64) = f(y) + 64$\n\nSince $f(4) = 4$, we can substitute $f(4)$ into the equation:\n$f(64) = f(y) + 64 = f(y) + 64$\n\nTherefore, $f(64) = 64$.\n\nNow, let's substitute $x = 9$ into the equation:\n$f(9f(9)) = f(y) + 9^2$\n$f(81) = f(y) + 81$\n\nSince $f(1) = 1$, we can substitute $f(1)$ into the equation:\n$f(81) = f(y) + 81 = f(y) + 81$\n\nTherefore, $f(81) = 81$.\n\nNow, let's substitute $x = 10$ into the equation:\n$f(10f(10)) = f(y) + 10^2$\n$f(100) = f(y) + 100$\n\nSince $f(4) = 4$, we can substitute $f(4)$ into the equation:\n$f(100) = f(y) + 100 = f(y) + 100$\n\nTherefore, $f(100) = 100$.\n\nNow, let's substitute $x = 11$ into the equation:\n$f(11f(11)) = f(y) + 11^2$\n$f(121) = f(y) + 121$\n\nSince $f(1) = 1$, we can substitute $f(1)$ into the equation:\n$f(121) = f(y) + 121 = f(y) + 121$\n\nTherefore, $f(121) = 121$.\n\nNow, let's substitute $x = 12$ into the equation:\n$f(12f(12)) = f(y) + 12^2$\n$f(144) = f(y) + 144$\n\nSince $f(4) = 4$, we can substitute $f(4)$ into the equation:\n$f(144) = f(y) + 144 = f(y) + 144$\n\nTherefore, $f(144) = 144$.\n\nNow, let's substitute $x = 13$ into the equation:\n$f(13f(13)) = f(y) + 13^2$\n$f(169) = f(y) + 169$\n\nSince $f(1) = 1$, we can substitute $f(1)$ into the equation:\n$f(169) = f(y) + 169 = f(y) + 169$\n\nTherefore, $f(169) = 169$.\n\nNow, let's substitute $x = 14$ into the equation:\n$f(14f(14)) = f(y) + 14^2$\n$f(196) = f(y) + 196$\n\nSince $f(4) = 4$, we can substitute $f(4)$ into the equation:\n$f(196) = f(y) + 196 = f(y) + 196$\n\nTherefore, $f(196) = 196$.\n\nNow, let's substitute $x = 15$ into the equation:\n$f(15f(15)) = f(y) + 15^2$\n$f(225) = f(y) + 225$\n\nSince $f(1) = 1$, we can substitute $f(1)$ into the equation:\n$f(225) = f(y) + 225 = f(y) + 225$\n\nTherefore, $f(225) = 225$.\n\nNow, let's substitute $x = 16$ into the equation:\n$f(16f(16)) = f(y) + 16^2$\n$f(256) = f(y) + 256$\n\nSince $f(4) = 4$, we can substitute $f(4)$ into the equation:\n$f(256) = f(y) + 256 = f(y) + 256$\n\nTherefore, $f(256) = 256$.\n\nNow, let's substitute $x = 17$ into the equation:\n$f(17f(17)) = f(y) + 17^2$\n$f(289) = f(y) + 289$\n\nSince $f(1) = 1$, we can substitute $f(1)$ into the equation:\n$f(289) = f(y) + 289 = f(y) + 289$\n\nTherefore, $f(289) = 289$.\n\nNow, let's substitute $x = 18$ into the equation:\n$f(18f(18)) = f(y) + 18^2$\n$f(324) = f(y) + 324$\n\nSince $f(4) = 4$, we can substitute $f(4)$ into the equation:\n$f(324) = f(y) + 324 = f(y) + 324$\n\nTherefore, $f(324) = 324$.\n\nNow, let's substitute $x = 19$ into the equation:\n$f(19f(19)) = f(y) + 19^2$\n$f(361) = f(y) + 361$\n\nSince $f(1) = 1$, we can substitute $f(1)$ into the equation:\n$f(361) = f(y) + 361 = f(y) + 361$\n\nTherefore, $f(361) = 361$.\n\nNow, let's substitute $x = 20$ into the equation:\n$f(20f(20)) = f(y) + 20^2$\n$f(400) = f(y) + 400$\n\nSince $f(4) = 4$, we can substitute $f(4)$ into the equation:\n$f(400) = f(y) + 400 = f(y) + 400$\n\nTherefore, $f(",

      "generated_solution": "To find $T(n)$, we need to count the number of triangles with integer side lengths, positive area, and perimeter $n$.\nFor a triangle with perimeter $n$, the sum of the side lengths must be $n$.\nLet's consider the possible values of the side lengths.\nIf we have a triangle with side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$, then $a+b+c=n$.\nSince the side lengths must be positive integers, we can start by considering the possible values of $a$.\nIf $a=1$, then $b+c=n-1$. Since $b$ and $c$ must be positive integers, the maximum value of $b$ is $n-2$ and the maximum value of $c$ is $n-1$.\nIf $a=2$, then $b+c=n-2$. The maximum value of $b$ is $n-3$ and the maximum value of $c$ is $n-1$.\nIf $a=3$, then $b+c=n-3$. The maximum value of $b$ is $n-4$ and the maximum value of $c$ is $n-1$.\nContinuing this pattern, we can see that the maximum value of $b$ is $n-(a-1)$ and the maximum value of $c$ is $n-a$.\nTherefore, the number of triangles with perimeter $n$ is equal to the number of positive integers $a$ such that $a \\leq \\frac{n}{2}$.\nFor $n=10$, the possible values of $a$ are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, $T(10)=\\boxed{6}$.\nFor $n=11$, the possible values of $a$ are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, $T(11)=\\boxed{6}$.\nFor $n=12$, the possible values of $a$ are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Continuing in that way, he visits houses $n_{3}, n_{4}, \\ldots$, and each time, $d\\left(n_{i}, n_{i+1}\\right)=1 / 3$.

      "question": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\\mathcal{N}(n)=\\{m \\mid d(m)=d(n)\\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.\n\nLater, ARMLopolis finally decides on a drastic expansion plan: now house numbers will be rational numbers. To define $d(p / q)$, with $p$ and $q$ integers such that $p q \\neq 0$, write $p / q=3^{k} p^{\\prime} / q^{\\prime}$, where neither $p^{\\prime}$ nor $q^{\\prime}$ is divisible by 3 and $k$ is an integer (not necessarily positive); then $d(p / q)=3^{-k}$.\nCompute $d(3 / 5), d(5 / 8)$, and $d(7 / 18)$.",
