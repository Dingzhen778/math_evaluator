Since $n$ is a positive integer, the maximum value of $n$ is $90$.\n   - Substituting $n = 90$ into the expression, we get $\\frac{90 + 90}{90} = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of $\\frac{a_n + 90}{n}$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",

We can use the properties of the sum of squares of integers to find the sum of all $n$ that satisfy the conditions.\n\nThe sum of the squares of 5 or fewer positive integers can be expressed as $n = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2$, where $a \\geq b \\geq c \\geq d \\geq e$ and $a, b, c, d, e$ are positive integers.\n\nWe can rewrite this as $n = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2) + (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2) + (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + (a^2 + b^2) + a^2$.\n\nThis can be further simplified to $n = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2) + (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2) + (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + (a^2 + b^2) + a^2$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all $n$ that satisfy the conditions is $1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 10^2 + 11^2 + 12^2 + 13^2 + 14^2 + 15^2 + 16^2 + 17^2 + 18^2 + 19^2 + 20^2 + 21^2 + 22^2 + 23^2 + 24^2 + 25^2$.\n\nThis sum can be calculated as $1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 100 + 121 + 144 + 169 + 196 + 225 + 256 + 289 + 324 + 361 + 400 + 441 + 484 + 529 + 576 + 625$.\n\nThe sum of these numbers is $1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 100 + 121 + 144 + 169 + 196 + 225 + 256 + 289 + 324 + 361 + 400 + 441 + 484 + 529 + 576 + 625 = 6665$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all $n$ that satisfy the conditions is $\\boxed{6665}$.",

This implies that $3$ must divide the entire expression inside the parentheses. Since $3$ is a prime number, it must divide each term in the parentheses individually.\n\n   - For $\\ln(n)$, since $n$ is an integer, $\\ln(n)$ is not an integer, and thus $3$ cannot divide $\\ln(n)$.\n   - For $\\gamma$, since $\\gamma$ is a constant, $3$ cannot divide $\\gamma$.\n   - For $\\frac{1}{2n}$, $3$ can divide $\\frac{1}{2n}$ if and only if $n$ is a multiple of 3.\n\n7. **Summing the Positive Integers $n$ for Which $3|p_n$:**\n\n   The only values of $n$ that satisfy $3|p_n$ are those that are multiples of 3. Therefore, the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that $3|p_n$ is the sum of all positive multiples of 3 up to some maximum value.\n\n   The sum of the first $k$ positive multiples of 3 is given by:\n\n   $$S = 3 + 6 + 9 + \\cdots + 3k = 3(1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + k)$$\n\n   The sum of the first $k$ positive integers is given by:\n\n   $$1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + k = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$$\n\n   Therefore:\n\n   $$S = 3 \\cdot \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} = \\frac{3k(k+1)}{2}$$\n\n8. **Finding the Maximum Value of $k$:**\n\n   The maximum value of $k$ for which $3|p_n$ is satisfied is when $k$ is the largest integer such that $3k(k+1) < 10^9$.

This gives us one solution.\n\nTherefore, the number of non-zero integer pairs $(a, b)$ that satisfy the given equation is $\\boxed{1}$.",

The divisors of 2005 are:\n   \\[\n   1, 5, 401, 2005\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate $\\chi(d)$ for each divisor:**\n   - For $d = 1$, $\\chi(1) = 1$ (since 1 is a sum of two squares in only one way: $1^2 + 0^2$).\n   - For $d = 5$, $\\chi(5) = 0$ (since 5 is not a sum of two squares).\n   - For $d = 401$, $\\chi(401) = 1$ (since 401 is a sum of two squares in only one way: $20^2 + 9^2$).\n   - For $d = 2005$, $\\chi(2005) = 0$ (since 2005 is not a sum of two squares).\n\n6. **Substitute the values into the formula:**\n   \\[\n   r_3(2005) = 8 \\left(1 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{2005}{1}} + 0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{2005}{5}} + 1 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{2005}{401}} + 0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{2005}{2005}}\\right)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   r_3(2005) = 8 \\left(1 \\cdot \\sqrt{2005} + 0 \\cdot \\sqrt{401} + 1 \\cdot \\sqrt{1}\\right)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   r_3(2005) = 8 \\left(\\sqrt{2005} + 0 + 1\\right)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   r_3(2005) = 8 \\left(\\sqrt{2005} + 1\\right)\n   \\]\n\n7. **Simplify the expression:**\n   Since $\\sqrt{2005}$ is not a simple integer, we need to approximate it.

Since the equation is a polynomial of degree 6, it has at most 6 positive integer solutions.

      "generated_solution": "Given the equation $10x^{3}+20y^{3}+2006xyz=2007z^{3}$, we aim to find the maximum value of $x+y+z$.\n\nFirst, we factor the left-hand side of the equation:\n\\begin{align*}\n10x^{3}+20y^{3}+2006xyz &= 2007z^{3} \\\\\n(2x)^{3}+(2y)^{3}+2006xyz &= 2007z^{3} \\\\\n(2x)^{3}+(2y)^{3}+2006xyz &= 2007z^{3} \\\\\n(2x+2y+2006z)(2x^{2}-2xy+2y^{2}) &= 2007z^{3} \\\\\n2(x+y+1003z)(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}) &= 2007z^{3} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nGiven that $x, y, z$ are integers, we can deduce that $x+y+1003z$ must be a factor of $2007$. The prime factorization of $2007$ is $3 \\times 223$. Therefore, $x+y+1003z$ must be a factor of $3$ or $223$.\n\nNext, we consider the case when $x+y+1003z = 3$:\n\\begin{align*}\nx^{2}-xy+y^{2} &= \\frac{2007z^{3}}{3} \\\\\nx^{2}-xy+y^{2} &= 671z^{3} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $x, y, z$ are integers, we can deduce that $x^{2}-xy+y^{2}$ must be a factor of $671$. The prime factorization of $671$ is $7 \\times 11 \\times 11$. Therefore, $x^{2}-xy+y^{2}$ must be a factor of $7$ or $11$.\n\nConsidering the possible values of $x^{2}-xy+y^{2}$, we have:\n- If $x^{2}-xy+y^{2} = 7$, then $x+y+1003z = 3$ and $x^{2}-xy+y^{2} = 7$ have no integer solutions.\n- If $x^{2}-xy+y^{2} = 11$, then $x+y+1003z = 3$ and $x^{2}-xy+y^{2} = 11$ have no integer solutions.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value for $x+y+1003z$ is $223$. Substituting this back into the equation, we get:\n\\begin{align*}\nx^{2}-xy+y^{2} &= \\frac{2007z^{3}}{223} \\\\\nx^{2}-xy+y^{2} &= 9z^{3} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nGiven that $x^{2}-xy+y^{2}$ must be a factor of $9$, we have:\n- If $x^{2}-xy+y^{2} = 9$, then $x+y+1003z = 223$ and $x^{2}-xy+y^{2} = 9$ have no integer solutions.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value for $x+y+1003z$ is $223$, and the only possible value for $x^{2}-xy+y^{2}$ is $9$. Solving for $x$ and $y$ under these conditions, we find that $x = 2$ and $y = 7$.\n\nThus, the maximum value of $x+y+z$ is $2+7+1003 = 1012$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum of $x+y+z$ is $\\boxed{1012}$.",

We need to find the integer part of the sum $\\sum_{k=4}^{106} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{k}}$.\n\n2. **Transforming the Inequality:**\n   To simplify the inequality, we can rewrite it as:\n   $$\n   \\begin{aligned}\n   &\\left(n + 1\\right)^{a+1} - n^{a+1} < n a^{a + 1} < n a^{n+1} - \\left(n - 1\\right)^{a+1} \\quad (-1 < a < 0)\n   \\end{aligned}\n   $$\n\n3. **Analyzing the Inequality:**\n   Notice that the inequality suggests that the term $n a^{a + 1}$ is between two other terms, which are both positive. This implies that $n a^{a + 1}$ is also positive.\n\n4. **Applying the Inequality to the Sum:**\n   Given that $n a^{a + 1}$ is positive, we can apply the inequality to the sum $\\sum_{k=4}^{106} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{k}}$:\n   $$\n   \\begin{aligned}\n   &\\left(n + 1\\right)^{a+1} - n^{a+1} < \\sum_{k=4}^{106} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{k}} < n a^{a + 1} < n a^{n+1} - \\left(n - 1\\right)^{a+1}\n   \\end{aligned}\n   $$\n\n5. **Evaluating the Sum:**\n   To find the integer part of the sum, we need to understand the behavior of the terms $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{k}}$ as $k$ ranges from 4 to 106. Since $k$ is an integer, $\\sqrt[3]{k}$ is also an integer, and $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{k}}$ is a positive fraction. The sum of these fractions will be less than 1, as each term is less than 1 and there are many terms.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   Therefore, the integer part of the sum $\\sum_{k=4}^{106} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{k}}$ is 0. This is because the sum of a large number of fractions, each less than 1, will be less than 1.\n\nHence, the integer part of $x$ is $\\boxed{0}$.",

This means for any $x_1 < x_2$, we have $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$. To find the number of such functions, we need to consider the number of ways to arrange the 10 elements in a strictly decreasing order. This is a permutation of 10 elements where each element is less than the previous one. The number of such permutations is given by the factorial of 10, which is $10!$.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference**: The total number of functions is $10!$. The number of functions with fixed points is 10. Therefore, the number of functions without fixed points is $10! - 10$.\n\nThus, the difference in the number of these two types of functions is $10! - 10 - 10 = 9! - 10$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{362880 - 10 = 362870}$.",

      "generated_solution": "To solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the degree of a polynomial and the number of roots it can have in a given interval. The key concept here is the Intermediate Value Theorem, which states that if a continuous function has a root in an interval, then it must have at least one root in that interval.\n\nGiven that the polynomial is of degree 2022, it means that the highest power of the variable x is 2022. This polynomial can have at most 2022 roots in total, including roots outside the interval (0,1). However, we are interested in the maximum number of roots it can have in the interval (0,1).\n\nSince the polynomial is continuous and has a leading coefficient of 1, it will cross the x-axis at most 2022 times. This means it can have at most 2022 roots in total. However, not all of these roots will necessarily be in the interval (0,1). Some roots may be outside this interval.\n\nTo find the maximum number of roots in the interval (0,1), we need to consider the behavior of the polynomial as x approaches 0 and 1. As x approaches 0, the polynomial will approach its value at x=0, which is 1 (since the leading coefficient is 1). As x approaches 1, the polynomial will approach its value at x=1, which is also 1 (since the polynomial is continuous and has a leading coefficient of 1).\n\nSince the polynomial is continuous and has a leading coefficient of 1, it will cross the x-axis at most 2022 times. However, not all of these crossings will necessarily be within the interval (0,1). The polynomial will cross the x-axis at x=0 and x=1, but these are not within the interval (0,1).\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of roots the polynomial can have in the interval (0,1) is the number of times it crosses the x-axis minus the two crossings at x=0 and x=1.

We can expand this expression as follows:\n\n\\[\n(x-y)(y-z)(x-z) = (x^{2}-y^{2})(y-z)\n\\]\n\nNow, let's substitute $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=1$ into the expression:\n\n\\[\n(x^{2}-y^{2})(y-z) = (1-z^{2})(y-z)\n\\]\n\nExpanding this, we get:\n\n\\[\n(1-z^{2})(y-z) = y^{2}-z^{2}-yz+z^{3}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's rewrite this expression in a more symmetric form:\n\n\\[\ny^{2}-z^{2}-yz+z^{3} = (y-z)^{2}+z^{2}(y-z)\n\\]\n\nSince $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=1$, we can express $y^{2}$ and $z^{2}$ in terms of $x^{2}$:\n\n\\[\ny^{2} = 1 - x^{2} - z^{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nz^{2} = 1 - x^{2} - y^{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these into our expression, we get:\n\n\\[\n(y-z)^{2}+z^{2}(y-z) = (1-x^{2}-z^{2}-z^{2}+x^{2}+z^{2})(y-z)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying further:\n\n\\[\n(y-z)^{2}+z^{2}(y-z) = (1-2z^{2})(y-z)\n\\]\n\nNow, let's consider the range of $z^{2}$ given $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=1$. Since $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=1$, we have $0 \\leq z^{2} \\leq 1$. This implies $-1 \\leq z \\leq 1$.\n\nWhen $z=0$, the expression $(1-2z^{2})(y-z)$ simplifies to $1$, which is the maximum value.

      "question": "If there are a total of 95 numbers, each of which can take any value in +1 or -1, and it is known that the sum of the pairwise products of these 95 numbers is positive, then what is the minimum possible value of this positive sum?",

      "generated_solution": "Let's denote the 95 numbers as $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{95}$. Each $a_i$ can take the value of +1 or -1. The sum of the pairwise products of these 95 numbers is given by:\n\n$$\nS = \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq 95} a_i a_j\n$$\n\nWe need to find the minimum possible value of $S$ under the condition that $S > 0$.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - Each $a_i$ can be either +1 or -1.\n   - The sum of the pairwise products of these 95 numbers is given by $S$.\n   - We need to find the minimum value of $S$ such that $S > 0$.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Sum of Products:**\n   - The sum of the pairwise products of 95 numbers can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     S = \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq 95} a_i a_j\n     \\]\n   - This sum can be rewritten as:\n     \\[\n     S = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \\right)^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 \\right)\n     \\]\n   - Since each $a_i$ can only be +1 or -1, the sum of all $a_i$ is 0:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i = 0\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     S = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 0^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( - \\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 \\right)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Minimizing the Sum of Squares:**\n   - The sum of squares of 95 numbers, each of which can only be 1 or 0, is minimized when all numbers are 0. This is because the sum of squares of 0 is 0, and the sum of squares of 1 is 1.\n   - Therefore, the minimum value of $\\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2$ is 0.\n\n4. **Calculating the Minimum Value of $S$:**\n   - Substituting the minimum value of $\\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2$ into the expression for $S$:\n     \\[\n     S = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( -0 \\right) = 0\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The minimum possible value of $S$ is 0, but since $S$ must be positive, we need to find the next smallest positive value.\n   - The next smallest positive value of $S$ occurs when all numbers are +1 or -1, but not all 0. This would be when there are 47 +1's and 48 -1's, or vice versa.\n\n6. **Calculating the Sum of Products for the Next Smallest Positive Value:**\n   - For 47 +1's and 48 -1's:\n     \\[\n     S = \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq 95} a_i a_j = \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq 95} (1)(-1) = -\\binom{95}{2}\n     \\]\n   - The binomial coefficient $\\binom{95}{2}$ is the number of ways to choose 2 elements from 95, which is:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{95}{2} = \\frac{95 \\times 94}{2} = 4470\n     \\]\n   - Therefore:\n     \\[\n     S = -4470\n     \\]\n\n7. **Final Answer:**\n   - The minimum possible value of $S$ that is positive is $-4470$.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-4470}\n\\]",

This means that these vectors form a closed polygon, which is a property of a cyclic quadrilateral.\n\n2. **Angle Analysis**:\n   - Since $ABCD$ is a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles are supplementary, i.e., $\\angle BAC + \\angle BDC = 180^\\circ$.\n   - Similarly, $\\angle ABC + \\angle ADC = 180^\\circ$.\n\n3. **Vector Magnitude and Angle Relationships**:\n   - From the given magnitude of $\\overrightarrow{AC}$, we have $|\\overrightarrow{AC}| = 4$.\n   - The angle $\\angle BAC$ can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\cos \\angle BAC = \\frac{\\overrightarrow{AB} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{AC}}{|\\overrightarrow{AB}||\\overrightarrow{AC}|}\n     \\]\n   - Similarly, $\\cos \\angle BDC = \\frac{\\overrightarrow{BD} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{AC}}{|\\overrightarrow{BD}||\\overrightarrow{AC}|}$.\n\n4. **Using the Law of Cosines**:\n   - By the Law of Cosines, we have:\n     \\[\n     |\\overrightarrow{AB}|^2 = |\\overrightarrow{AC}|^2 + |\\overrightarrow{BC}|^2 - 2|\\overrightarrow{AC}||\\overrightarrow{BC}|\\cos \\angle BAC\n     \\]\n   - Similarly, for $\\overrightarrow{BD}$:\n     \\[\n     |\\overrightarrow{BD}|^2 = |\\overrightarrow{AC}|^2 + |\\overrightarrow{CD}|^2 - 2|\\overrightarrow{AC}||\\overrightarrow{CD}|\\cos \\angle BDC\n     \\]\n\n5. **Summing the Equations**:\n   - Adding the two equations, we get:\n     \\[\n     |\\overrightarrow{AB}|^2 + |\\overrightarrow{BD}|^2 = 2|\\overrightarrow{AC}|^2 + |\\overrightarrow{BC}|^2 + |\\overrightarrow{CD}|^2 - 2|\\overrightarrow{AC}||\\overrightarrow{BC}|\\cos \\angle BAC - 2|\\overrightarrow{AC}||\\overrightarrow{CD}|\\cos \\angle BDC\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we find:\n     \\[\n     |\\overrightarrow{AB}|^2 + |\\overrightarrow{BD}|^2 = 2|\\overrightarrow{AC}|^2 + |\\overrightarrow{BC}|^2 + |\\overrightarrow{CD}|^2 - 2|\\overrightarrow{AC}||\\overrightarrow{BC}|\\cos \\angle BAC - 2|\\overrightarrow{AC}||\\overrightarrow{CD}|\\cos \\angle BDC\n     \\]\n\n6. **Maximizing the Expression**:\n   - To maximize $|\\overrightarrow{AB}|+|\\overrightarrow{BC}|$, we need to minimize $|\\overrightarrow{AB}|^2 + |\\overrightarrow{BD}|^2$.\n   - This occurs when $\\cos \\angle BAC = \\cos \\angle BDC = -\\frac{1}{2}$, which implies $\\angle BAC = 120^\\circ$ and $\\angle BDC = 60^\\circ$.\n\n7. **Calculating the Maximum Value**:\n   - Substituting $\\cos \\angle BAC = -\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\cos \\angle BDC = -\\frac{1}{2}$ into the equation, we get:\n     \\[\n     |\\overrightarrow{AB}|^2 + |\\overrightarrow{BD}|^2 = 2|\\overrightarrow{AC}|^2 + |\\overrightarrow{BC}|^2 + |\\overrightarrow{CD}|^2 - 2|\\overrightarrow{AC}||\\overrightarrow{BC}|\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - 2|\\overrightarrow{AC}||\\overrightarrow{CD}|\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we find:\n     \\[\n     |\\overrightarrow{AB}|^2 + |\\overrightarrow{BD}|^2 = 2|\\overrightarrow{AC}|^2 + |\\overrightarrow{BC}|^2 + |\\overrightarrow{CD}|^2 + |\\overrightarrow{AC}||\\overrightarrow{BC}| + |\\overrightarrow{AC}||\\overrightarrow{CD}|\n     \\]\n   - Since $|\\overrightarrow{AB}| + |\\overrightarrow{BC}| = |\\overrightarrow{BD}| + |\\overrightarrow{CD}|$, we have:\n     \\[\n     |\\overrightarrow{AB}| + |\\overrightarrow{BC}| = \\sqrt{2|\\overrightarrow{AC}|^2 + |\\overrightarrow{BC}|^2 + |\\overrightarrow{CD}|^2 + |\\overrightarrow{AC}||\\overrightarrow{BC}| + |\\overrightarrow{AC}||\\overrightarrow{CD}|}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting $|\\overrightarrow{AC}| = 4$, we get:\n     \\[\n     |\\overrightarrow{AB}| + |\\overrightarrow{BC}| = \\sqrt{2(4)^2 + |\\overrightarrow{BC}|^2 + |\\overrightarrow{CD}|^2 + 4|\\overrightarrow{BC}| + 4|\\overrightarrow{CD}|}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying further, we find:\n     \\[\n     |\\overrightarrow{AB}| + |\\overrightarrow{BC}| = \\sqrt{32 + |\\overrightarrow{BC}|^2 + |\\overrightarrow{CD}|^2 + 4|\\overrightarrow{BC}| + 4|\\overrightarrow{CD}|}\n     \\]\n\n8. **Conclusion**:\n   - The maximum value of $|\\overrightarrow{AB}| + |\\overrightarrow{BC}|$ is achieved when $\\angle BAC = 120^\\circ$ and $\\angle BDC = 60^\\circ$, which is:\n     \\[\n     \\boxed{8}\n     \\]",

For any two holidays, there is at least one dwarf who wears hats of different colors on the two occasions. The question is: how many holidays can the dwarves celebrate at most?",

      "generated_solution": "1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - There are 66 dwarfs and 111 hats.\n   - Each hat is dyed in one of 66 colors.\n   - Each dwarf wears his own hat.\n   - For any holiday, the colors of the hats worn by all dwarfs are different.\n   - For any two holidays, there is at least one dwarf who wears hats of different colors on the two occasions.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Constraints:**\n   - Since each hat is dyed in one of 66 colors, and there are 111 hats, it implies that some colors must be repeated.\n   - If each color were used exactly once, we would have 66 colors, which is not possible because there are 111 hats.\n\n3. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Holidays:**\n   - Let's assume that the maximum number of holidays is \\( n \\).\n   - On the first holiday, each dwarf wears a different hat, so there are 66 different colors.\n   - On the second holiday, at least one dwarf must wear a hat of a different color from the first holiday. This means at least 65 colors are used on the second holiday.\n   - Continuing this pattern, on the \\( n \\)-th holiday, at least \\( 66 - n \\) different colors are used.\n\n4. **Summing Up the Colors:**\n   - The total number of different colors used over \\( n \\) holidays is:\n     \\[\n     66 + (66 - 1) + (66 - 2) + \\ldots + (66 - (n - 1))\n     \\]\n   - This is an arithmetic series with the first term \\( a = 66 \\), the last term \\( l = 66 - (n - 1) = 67 - n \\), and the number of terms \\( n \\).\n\n5. **Summing the Series:**\n   - The sum \\( S \\) of an arithmetic series is given by:\n     \\[\n     S = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l)\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the values:\n     \\[\n     S = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (66 + (67 - n))\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     S = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (133 - n)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     S = \\frac{n}{2} \\times 133 - \\frac{n^2}{2}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     S = \\frac{133n}{2} - \\frac{n^2}{2}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     S = \\frac{133n - n^2}{2}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Setting Up the Inequality:**\n   - We know that the total number of different colors used over \\( n \\) holidays must be less than or equal to the total number of hats, which is 111:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{133n - n^2}{2} \\leq 111\n     \\]\n\n7. **Solving the Inequality:**\n   - Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:\n     \\[\n     133n - n^2 \\leq 222\n     \\]\n   - Rearrange the inequality:\n     \\[\n     n^2 - 133n + 222 \\geq 0\n     \\]\n   - Factor the quadratic equation:\n     \\[\n     n^2 - 133n + 222 = (n - 11)(n - 22) \\geq 0\n     \\]\n   - Solve the inequality:\n     \\[\n     n \\leq 11 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad n \\geq 22\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( n \\) must be an integer, the only possible value is \\( n = 22 \\).\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - Therefore, the maximum number of holidays the dwarfs can celebrate is \\(\\boxed{22}\\).",

This implies that $|a_{i}-i|+1$ must be a power of 2 for each $i$.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can deduce the following:\n\n- From condition 1, we have $a_{10} \\leqslant 40$.\n- From condition 2, we have $a_{4} \\geqslant 6$.\n- From condition 3, we have $|a_{i}-i|+1$ must be a power of 2 for each $i$.\n\nLet's analyze the implications of condition 3:\n\n- For $i=1$, we have $|a_{1}-1|+1 = 2^{k_{1}}$ for some integer $k_{1}$.\n- For $i=2$, we have $|a_{2}-2|+1 = 2^{k_{2}}$ for some integer $k_{2}$.\n- ...\n- For $i=10$, we have $|a_{10}-10|+1 = 2^{k_{10}}$ for some integer $k_{10}$.\n\nGiven that $a_{1} \\leqslant a_{2} \\leqslant \\cdots \\leqslant a_{10}$, we can deduce that $k_{1} \\leqslant k_{2} \\leqslant \\cdots \\leqslant k_{10}$.\n\nSince $k_{1} \\leqslant k_{2} \\leqslant \\cdots \\leqslant k_{10}$ and $k_{1}, k_{2}, \\cdots, k_{10}$ are integers, we can conclude that $k_{1} = k_{2} = \\cdots = k_{10} = k$ for some integer $k$.\n\nTherefore, we have $|a_{i}-i|+1 = 2^{k}$ for all $i$.\n\nThis implies that $a_{i} = 2^{k}-i+1$ for all $i$.\n\nGiven that $a_{4} \\geqslant 6$, we have $2^{k}-4+1 \\geqslant 6$. Solving for $k$, we get $2^{k} \\geqslant 9$, which implies $k \\geqslant 3$.\n\nTherefore, the possible values for $k$ are $3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10$.\n\nFor each value of $k$, we have $2^{k}$ possible values for $a_{1}$, and for each value of $a_{1}$, we have $2^{k-1}$ possible values for $a_{2}$, and so on, up to $2^{1}$ possible values for $a_{10}$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of sequences is $2^{k} \\times 2^{k-1} \\times \\cdots \\times 2^{1} = 2^{k(k+1)/2}$.\n\nSubstituting $k=3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10$, we get the number of sequences as $2^{6}, 2^{10}, 2^{15}, 2^{21}, 2^{28}, 2^{36}, 2^{45}, 2^{55}$, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the number of such sequences is $\\boxed{2^{6} + 2^{10} + 2^{15} + 2^{21} + 2^{28} + 2^{36} + 2^{45} + 2^{55}}$.",

      "generated_solution": "To find the rate of change described by the function $c = -3n + 60$, we need to determine how the cost $c$ changes as the number of people $n$ changes. The rate of change is given by the slope of the linear function, which in this case is the coefficient of $n$.\n\nGiven the function $c = -3n + 60$, we can see that the coefficient of $n$ is $-3$. This coefficient represents the rate at which the cost $c$ changes as $n$ changes. Specifically, it indicates that for every additional person, the cost decreases by $3$ dollars.\n\nTherefore, the rate of change described by the function is a decrease of $3$ dollars per person.

This means that as \\\\( x \\\\) approaches infinity, \\\\( f(x) \\\\) will also approach infinity. Therefore, statement IV is true.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Roots**: To determine the number of real roots, we can use the Rational Root Theorem, which states that any rational root of a polynomial must be a factor of the constant term divided by the leading coefficient. In this case, the constant term is -36 and the leading coefficient is 1. The possible rational roots are \\\\( \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 4, \\pm 6, \\pm 9, \\pm 12, \\pm 18, \\pm 36 \\\\). Testing these values, we find that \\\\( f(2) = 2^5 + 3(2)^4 + 9(2)^3 - 23(2)^2 - 36 = 32 + 48 + 72 - 92 - 36 = 64 \\\\), which is not zero. Therefore, \\\\( f(x) \\\\) does not have any rational roots. Since \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is a polynomial of degree 5, it must have exactly 5 real roots. Thus, statement I is true.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Imaginary Roots**: Since \\\\( f(x) \\\\) has no rational roots and is a polynomial of degree 5, it must have 5 real roots. Therefore, statement II, which suggests \\\\( f(x) \\\\) has three imaginary roots, is false.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Double Root**: To determine if \\\\( f(x) \\\\) has a double root, we can use the discriminant of the quadratic part of the polynomial. The quadratic part is \\\\( x^2 + 3x^4 + 9x^3 - 23x^2 \\\\), which can be rewritten as \\\\( x^2(x^3 + 3x^2 + 9x - 23) \\\\). The discriminant of the quadratic part is \\\\( 3^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-23) = 9 + 92 = 101 \\\\), which is positive. This indicates that the quadratic part has two distinct real roots. Since the polynomial is of degree 5, it cannot have a double root. Therefore, statement III is false.\n\nGiven the analysis above, the true statements are I and IV.

The base of the triangle is the distance between $(1,1,1)$ and $(2,5,5)$, and the height is the perpendicular distance from $(5,2,5)$ to the line connecting $(1,1,1)$ and $(2,5,5)$.\n\n3. **Find the base and height**: The base is the distance between $(1,1,1)$ and $(2,5,5)$, which is calculated as $\\sqrt{(2-1)^2 + (5-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{17}$. The height is the distance from $(5,2,5)$ to the line connecting $(1,1,1)$ and $(2,5,5)$. This distance can be found using the formula for the distance from a point to a line, but since the line is not explicitly given, we can use the fact that the height is the perpendicular distance from $(5,2,5)$ to the line connecting $(1,1,1)$ and $(2,5,5)$. This distance is the difference in the z-coordinates of $(5,2,5)$ and $(1,1,1)$, which is $5 - 1 = 4$.\n\n4. **Calculate the area of the base triangle**: Using the area formula, we have $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\sqrt{17} \\times 4 = 2\\sqrt{17}$.\n\n5. **Find the height of the pyramid**: The height of the pyramid is the distance from the apex $(5,5,2)$ to the plane of the base. This distance can be found using the formula for the distance from a point to a plane, but since the plane is not explicitly given, we can use the fact that the height is the distance from $(5,5,2)$ to the line connecting $(1,1,1)$ and $(2,5,5)$. This distance is the difference in the y-coordinates of $(5,5,2)$ and $(1,1,1)$, which is $5 - 1 = 4$.\n\n6. **Calculate the volume of the pyramid**: The volume of a pyramid is given by $\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{base area} \\times \\text{height}$. Substituting the values we have, we get $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 2\\sqrt{17} \\times 4 = \\frac{8\\sqrt{17}}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the volume of the triangular pyramid is $\\boxed{\\frac{8\\sqrt{17}}{3}}$.",

According to the Remainder Theorem, if $f(x)$ is a polynomial and $p$ is a number, then $f(p)$ is the remainder when $f(x)$ is divided by $x - p$. \n\nGiven that $x^2 - x + a$ is a factor of $x^{13} + x + 90$, we can use the Remainder Theorem to find $a$ by setting $p = a$ and calculating $f(a) = 0$.\n\nLet's set $f(x) = x^{13} + x + 90$. We need to find $a$ such that $f(a) = 0$.\n\n1. Substitute $x = a$ into $f(x)$:\n   \\[\n   f(a) = a^{13} + a + 90\n   \\]\n\n2. Set $f(a) = 0$:\n   \\[\n   a^{13} + a + 90 = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. Rearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation:\n   \\[\n   a^{13} + a = -90\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a^{13} + a + 90 = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a^{13} + a + 90 = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a^{13} + a = -90\n   \\]\n\n4. Factor out $a$:\n   \\[\n   a(a^{12} + 1) = -90\n   \\]\n\n5. Solve for $a$:\n   \\[\n   a^{12} + 1 = -90\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a^{12} = -90 - 1\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a^{12} = -91\n   \\]\n\n6. Since $a^{12} = -91$, we need to find the twelfth roots of -91. The twelfth roots of -1 are $e^{i\\pi}$ and $e^{-i\\pi}$, and the twelfth roots of -1 are $e^{i\\pi/6}$ and $e^{-i\\pi/6}$. Therefore, the twelfth roots of -91 are $e^{i\\pi/6}$ and $e^{-i\\pi/6}$.\n\n7. Since $a^{12} = -91$, we have:\n   \\[\n   a = e^{i\\pi/6} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad a = e^{-i\\pi/6}\n   \\]\n\n8. Since $a$ must be an integer, we consider the real part of the complex numbers. The real part of $e^{i\\pi/6}$ is $\\cos(\\pi/6) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, and the real part of $e^{-i\\pi/6}$ is $\\cos(-\\pi/6) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\n9. Therefore, the possible values for $a$ are $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\text{ or } -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$.",

Therefore, the number of vials from Vendor A is (2/5)V and from Vendor B is (3/5)V.\n\nFor Vendor A, 3% of the vials are ineffective, so the number of ineffective vials from Vendor A is (3/100) * (2/5)V = (6/500)V.\n\nFor Vendor B, 8% of the vials are ineffective, so the number of ineffective vials from Vendor B is (8/100) * (3/5)V = (24/500)V.\n\nThe total number of ineffective vials in the shipment is the sum of the ineffective vials from both vendors, which is (6/500)V + (24/500)V = (30/500)V.\n\nThe probability of selecting an ineffective vial from the shipment is the ratio of the number of ineffective vials to the total number of vials, which is (30/500)V / V = 30/500.\n\nThe probability of selecting two ineffective vials in a row is the square of this probability, because the selection of the first vial does not affect the selection of the second vial (assuming the vials are selected independently).\n\nSo, the probability of selecting two ineffective vials in a row is (30/500)^2 = (3/50)^2 = 9/2500.\n\nGiven that 2 out of 25 vials are ineffective, the probability that this shipment came from Vendor A is the ratio of the probability of selecting two ineffective vials from Vendor A to the total probability of selecting two ineffective vials from either vendor.\n\nThe probability of selecting two ineffective vials from Vendor A is (6/500)^2 = (3/250)^2 = 9/12500.\n\nThe total probability of selecting two ineffective vials from either vendor is (9/2500) + (9/12500) = 9/2500 + 9/12500 = 9/2500 + 9/2500 = 18/2500.\n\nTherefore, the probability that this shipment came from Vendor A is (9/12500) / (18/2500) = (9/12500) * (2500/18) = 9/225 = 1/25.\n\nSo, the probability that this shipment came from Vendor A is \\boxed{1/25}.",

Since the accidents are independent and follow an exponential distribution, we can calculate the probability for each minute and then sum them up.\n\nThe probability of having one accident in a minute is given by the exponential distribution function $f(t) = 0.4e^{-0.4t}$, where $t$ is the time in minutes. For one minute, $t = 1$, so the probability is $0.4e^{-0.4 \\cdot 1} = 0.4e^{-0.4}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability of having one accident in the first minute is $0.4e^{-0.4}$, in the second minute is $0.4e^{-0.4}$, and so on, up to the fifth minute.

Substituting $x = 2$ into the expression for $\\mathbb{E}|X-x|$, we get:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}|X-2| = (2-1)e^{-2} + 1 = e^{-2} + 1\n$$\n\nThus, the minimum value of $\\mathbb{E}|X-x|$ is $\\boxed{e^{-2} + 1}$.",

      "generated_solution": "1. **Identify the given information and the problem statement:**\n   - The random variables $X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n$ are i.i.d. samples from the population density function:\n     \\[\n     f(x|\\theta) = \\frac{2}{\\theta} x e^{-x^2/\\theta} I(x > 0), \\quad \\theta > 0.\n     \\]\n   - We need to find the uniformly most powerful (UMP) test for $H_0: \\theta \\leq \\theta_0$ against $H_1: \\theta > \\theta_0$.\n   - The critical value for the chi-square distribution with $2n$ degrees of freedom is $\\chi_{2n, \\alpha}^2$ such that $P(\\chi_{2n}^2 > \\chi_{2n, \\alpha}^2) = \\alpha$.\n   - The UMP test should reject $H_0$ if $\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 > \\frac{\\theta_0}{2} \\chi_{2n, \\alpha}^2$.\n\n2. **Define the likelihood ratio test statistic:**\n   - The likelihood ratio test statistic is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\lambda = \\frac{\\sup_{\\theta \\leq \\theta_0} L(\\theta)}{\\sup_{\\theta > \\theta_0} L(\\theta)}.\n     \\]\n   - The likelihood function $L(\\theta)$ is:\n     \\[\n     L(\\theta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n f(X_i|\\theta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{2}{\\theta} X_i e^{-X_i^2/\\theta} I(X_i > 0).\n     \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the likelihood function:**\n   - Since $X_i > 0$, the indicator function $I(X_i > 0)$ is 1 for all $i$.\n   - The likelihood function becomes:\n     \\[\n     L(\\theta) = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\theta}\\right)^n \\prod_{i=1}^n X_i e^{-X_i^2/\\theta}.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Maximize the likelihood function under $H_0: \\theta \\leq \\theta_0$:**\n   - For $\\theta \\leq \\theta_0$, the maximum likelihood occurs when $\\theta = \\theta_0$:\n     \\[\n     L(\\theta_0) = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\theta_0}\\right)^n \\prod_{i=1}^n X_i e^{-X_i^2/\\theta_0}.\n     \\]\n\n5. **Maximize the likelihood function under $H_1: \\theta > \\theta_0$:**\n   - For $\\theta > \\theta_0$, the maximum likelihood occurs when $\\theta = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2$:\n     \\[\n     L\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2}\\right)^n \\prod_{i=1}^n X_i e^{-X_i^2/\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2\\right)}.\n     \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the likelihood ratio:**\n   - The likelihood ratio is:\n     \\[\n     \\lambda = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2}{\\theta_0}\\right)^n \\prod_{i=1}^n X_i e^{-X_i^2/\\theta_0}}{\\left(\\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2}\\right)^n \\prod_{i=1}^n X_i e^{-X_i^2/\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2\\right)}}.\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the expression:\n     \\[\n     \\lambda = \\left(\\frac{\\theta_0}{\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2}\\right)^n.\n     \\]\n\n7. **Set up the critical region:**\n   - The critical region for the UMP test is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\lambda > 1 \\implies \\left(\\frac{\\theta_0}{\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2}\\right)^n > 1.\n     \\]\n   - Taking the $n$-th root of both sides:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\theta_0}{\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2} > 1.\n     \\]\n   - Solving for $\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2$:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 < \\theta_0.\n     \\]\n\n8. **Compare with the given condition:**\n   - The given condition for the UMP test is:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 > \\frac{\\theta_0}{2} \\chi_{2n, \\alpha}^2.\n     \\]\n   - This condition is equivalent to:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 > \\frac{\\theta_0}{2} \\chi_{2n, \\alpha}^2.\n     \\]\n\n9. **Conclusion:**\n   - The UMP test for $H_0: \\theta \\leq \\theta_0$ against $H_1: \\theta > \\theta_0$ should reject $H_0$ if:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 > \\frac{\\theta_0}{2} \\chi_{2n, \\alpha}^2.\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the final answer is:\n     \\[\n     \\boxed{\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 > \\frac{\\theta_0}{2} \\chi_{2n, \\alpha}^2}.\n     \\]",
