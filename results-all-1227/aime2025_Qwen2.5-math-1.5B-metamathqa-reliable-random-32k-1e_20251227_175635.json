      "question": "An isosceles trapezoid has an inscribed circle tangent to each of its four sides. The radius of the circle is 3, and the area of the trapezoid is 72. Let the parallel sides of the trapezoid have lengths $r$ and $s$, with $r \\neq s$. Find $r^{2}+s^{2}$.",
      "reference_answer": "504",
      "predicted_answer": "21",
      "generated_solution": "The area of the trapezoid is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}(r+s)h$, where $h$ is the height of the trapezoid. Since the trapezoid has an inscribed circle, the height of the trapezoid is equal to the diameter of the circle, which is $2r = 6$.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the area formula, we have $72 = \\frac{1}{2}(r+s)(6)$. Simplifying, we get $24 = (r+s)(3)$, which implies $r+s = 8$.\n\nWe also know that the radius of the inscribed circle is equal to the distance from the center of the circle to any side of the trapezoid. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the center of the circle is equidistant from the two parallel sides. Therefore, the distance from the center of the circle to each parallel side is equal to the radius of the circle, which is 3.\n\nLet $d$ be the distance from the center of the circle to the shorter parallel side. Then, the distance from the center of the circle to the longer parallel side is $8-d$. Since the distance from the center of the circle to each parallel side is equal to the radius of the circle, we have $d = 3$ and $8-d = 5$.\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of the parallel sides. Let $h$ be the height of the trapezoid. Then, we have $h^2 = (8-d)^2 - d^2 = 5^2 - 3^2 = 25 - 9 = 16$.\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $h = 4$.\n\nFinally, we can find $r^2 + s^2$ by using the formula $r^2 + s^2 = (r+s)^2 - 2rs$. Since $r+s = 8$ and $rs = (r+s)^2 - (r^2 + s^2)) = 8^2 - (r^2 + s^2))$, we have $r^2 + s^2 = 8^2 - 2(8^2 - (r^2 + s^2)))$.\n\nSimplifying, we get $r^2 + s^2 = 64 - 2(64 - (r^2 + s^2))) = 64 - 128 + 2(r^2 + s^2))$.\n\nRearranging, we have $3(r^2 + s^2)) = 64$, which implies $r^2 + s^2 = \\frac{64}{3}$.\n\nSince $r^2 + s^2$ must be an integer, we round $\\frac{64}{3}$ to the nearest integer, which is 21.\n\nTherefore, the value of $r^2 + s^2$ is $\\boxed{21}$.\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe answer is: 21\nThe",

      "generated_solution": "The given system of equations can be rewritten as:\n$|25+20i-z|=5$\n$|z-4-k|=|z-3i-k|$\n\nThe first equation represents a circle in the complex plane with center $25+20i$ and radius 5. The second equation represents the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining the points $4+k$ and $3i+k$.\n\nFor the system to have exactly one complex solution, the circle and the perpendicular bisector must intersect at exactly one point. This occurs when the center of the circle lies on the perpendicular bisector.\n\nThe center of the circle is $25+20i$, and the midpoint of the line segment joining the points $4+k$ and $3i+k$ is $\\frac{(4+k)+(3i+k)}{2} = 2+k+i$.\n\nFor the center of the circle to lie on the perpendicular bisector, we must have:\n$25+20i = 2+k+i$\n\nSolving this equation for $k$, we get:\n$k = 23+19i$\n\nSince $k$ is a real number, the imaginary part of $k$ must be 0. Therefore, the only possible value of $k$ is 23.\n\nThe sum of all possible values of $k$ is simply 23, which can be written as $\\frac{23}{1}$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{24}$.\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24\nThe answer is: 24",

      "generated_solution": "The given function $f(x)$ is periodic with period 4. The graph of $f(x)$ has the sawtooth pattern, which means that the function increases linearly from $-1$ to $1$, then decreases linearly from $1$ to $3$, and repeats this pattern every 4 units.\n\nThe parabola $x=34y^2$ intersects the graph of $f(x)$ at finitely many points. To find these intersection points, we need to solve the equation $34y^2 = f(x)$ for $x$ in the interval $[-1,3)$.\n\nFor $x\\in[-1,1)$, we have $f(x)=x$. So, we need to solve the equation $34y^2 = x$ for $x$ in the interval $[-1,1)$. This equation has two solutions for $x$ in this interval: $x=-\\frac{1}{34}y^2$ and $x=\\frac{1}{34}y^2$.\n\nFor $x\\in[1,3)$, we have $f(x)=2-x$. So, we need to solve the equation $34y^2 = 2-x$ for $x$ in the interval $[1,3)$. This equation has two solutions for $x$ in this interval: $x=2-\\frac{1}{34}y^2$ and $x=2-\\frac{3}{34}y^2$.\n\nThe sum of the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points can be found by summing the $y$-coordinates of the solutions to the equations $34y^2 = x$ and $34y^2 = 2-x$ for $x$ in the interval $[-1,3)$.\n\nThe sum of the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points is $\\frac{1}{34}y^2 + \\frac{1}{34}y^2 + 2-\\frac{1}{34}y^2 + 2-\\frac{3}{34}y^2 = \\frac{1}{17}y^2 + 4-\\frac{4}{34}y^2 = \\frac{1}{17}y^2 + 4-\\frac{2}{17}y^2 = 4-\\frac{1}{17}y^2$.\n\nSince the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points can be expressed in the form $\\frac{a+b\\sqrt{c}}{d}$, where $a,b,c,$ and $d$ are positive integers, $a,b,$ and $d$ have greatest common divisor equal to 1, and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, we have $a=4$, $b=0$, $c=1$, and $d=1$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points is $\\frac{4+0\\sqrt{1}}{1} = 4$.\n\nThe answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The answer is: 4\\boxed{4}The",

To solve this problem, we need to determine the boundaries of the region and then calculate its area.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the given inequalities:\n$x-yz<y-zx<z-xy$\n\nWe can rewrite these inequalities as:\n$x-yz-y+zx<0$\n$y-zx-z+xy<0$\n$z-xy-x+y<0$\n\nLet's simplify these inequalities:\n$x(1-y)+y(z-1)<0$\n$y(1-x)+z(x-1)<0$\n$z(1-y)+x(y-1)<0$\n\nNow, let's consider the plane $x+y+z=75$.

      "generated_solution": "The prime factorization of 2025 is $3^4 \\cdot 5^2$.\nThe set $A$ consists of all positive integer divisors of 2025, which can be represented as $3^a \\cdot 5^b$ where $0 \\leq a \\leq 4$ and $0 \\leq b \\leq 2$.\nThe total number of elements in $A$ is $(4+1)(2+1) = 5 \\cdot 3 = 15$.\nTo find the probability that a randomly selected subset $B$ of $A$ has the property that the least common multiple of its elements is 2025, we need to count the number of subsets $B$ that satisfy this condition.\nA subset $B$ will have the property that the least common multiple of its elements is 2025 if and only if $B$ contains at least one element of the form $3^a \\cdot 5^b$ for each $a$ and $b$.\nThe number of subsets $B$ that contain at least one element of the form $3^a \\cdot 5^b$ for each $a$ and $b$ is equal to the number of ways to choose at least one element from each of the 15 elements in $A$.\nThis can be calculated using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\nThe number of ways to choose at least one element from each of the 15 elements in $A$ is equal to the sum of the number of ways to choose at least one element from each of the 15 elements in $A$, minus the sum of the number of ways to choose at least one element from each of the 14 elements in $A$, plus the sum of the number of ways to choose at least one element from each of the 13 elements in $A$, and so on.\nThis can be calculated as follows:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Number of ways to choose at least one element from each of the 15 elements in } A &= \\binom{15}{1} - \\binom{15}{2} + \\binom{15}{3} - \\binom{15}{4} + \\binom{15}{5} - \\binom{15}{6} + \\binom{15}{7} - \\binom{15}{8} + \\binom{15}{9} - \\binom{15}{10} + \\binom{15}{11} - \\binom{15}{12} + \\binom{15}{13} - \\binom{15}{14} + \\binom{15}{15} \\\\\n&= 15 - \\binom{15}{2} + \\binom{15}{3} - \\binom{15}{4} + \\binom{15}{5} - \\binom{15}{6} + \\binom{15}{7} - \\binom{15}{8} + \\binom{15}{9} - \\binom{15}{10} + \\binom{15}{11} - \\binom{15}{12} + \\binom{15}{13} - \\binom{15}{14} + \\binom{15}{15} \\\\\n&= 15 - 105 + 455 - 1365 + 3003 - 5005 + 6435 - 6435 + 5005 - 3003 + 1365 - 455 + 105 - 15 \\\\\n&= 1.\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected subset $B$ of $A$ has the property that the least common multiple of its elements is 2025 is $\\frac{1}{2^{15}} = \\frac{1}{32768}$.\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32768\nThe answer is: 32",

      "question": "From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $ N $ cents, where $ N $ is a positive integer. He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.",
