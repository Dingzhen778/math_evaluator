      "generated_solution": "1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   We need to find the sum of all integer bases $b > 9$ for which $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b$. This means we need to find bases $b$ such that $17_b \\mid 97_b$.\n\n2. **Expressing in Decimal Form:**\n   - $17_b$ in decimal is $1b + 7$.\n   - $97_b$ in decimal is $9b + 7$.\n\n3. **Setting Up the Congruence:**\n   We need to solve the congruence:\n   \\[\n   9b + 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{1b + 7}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   9b + 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{1b + 7}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   9b + 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{1b + 7}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplifying the Congruence:**\n   \\[\n   9b + 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{1b + 7}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   9b + 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{1b + 7}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   9b + 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{1b + 7}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Finding the Divisors:**\n   We need to find $b$ such that $1b + 7$ divides $9b + 7$. This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   1b + 7 \\mid 9b + 7\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1b + 7 \\mid 8b + 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1b + 7 \\mid 8b\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1b + 7 \\mid 8b\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solving for $b$:**\n   \\[\n   1b + 7 \\mid 8b\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1b + 7 \\mid 8b\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1b + 7 \\mid 8b\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1b + 7 \\mid 8b\n   \\]\n\n7. **Finding the Values of $b$:**\n   We need to find $b$ such that $1b + 7$ divides $8b$. This implies:\n   \\[\n   1b + 7 = 8b\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1b + 7 = 8b\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1b + 7 = 8b\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1b + 7 = 8b\n   \\]\n\n8. **Solving the Equation:**\n   \\[\n   1b + 7 = 8b\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   7 = 8b - b\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   7 = 7b\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 = b\n   \\]\n\n9. **Conclusion:**\n   The only integer base $b > 9$ that satisfies the condition is $b = 1$. Therefore, the sum of all such bases is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{1}\n   \\]",

We will use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the critical points of the function $f(x, y, z) = x - yz$ under the constraint $g(x, y, z) = x + y + z - 75 = 0$. The critical points will give us the vertices of the region of interest.\n\n1. **Identify the critical points:**\n   We need to find the critical points of $f(x, y, z) = x - yz$ under the constraint $g(x, y, z) = x + y + z - 75 = 0$. The Lagrange multipliers method gives us the system of equations:\n   \\[\n   \\nabla f = \\lambda \\nabla g\n   \\]\n   This leads to the system:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{cases}\n   1 = \\lambda \\\\\n   -z = \\lambda \\\\\n   -y = \\lambda\n   \\end{cases}\n   \\]\n   Solving this system, we find that $\\lambda = 1$ and $x = y = z$. Substituting $x = y = z$ into the constraint $g(x, y, z) = 0$, we get:\n   \\[\n   3x - 75 = 0 \\implies x = 25\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the critical points are $(25, 25, 25)$.\n\n2. **Determine the region of interest:**\n   The region of interest is the intersection of the plane $x + y + z = 75$ and the inequalities $x - yz < y - zx < z - xy$. Substituting $x = y = z = 25$ into these inequalities, we get:\n   \\[\n   25 - 25^2 < 25 - 25^2 < 25 - 25^2\n   \\]\n   Since $25^2 = 625$, all inequalities are satisfied, indicating that the point $(25, 25, 25)$ is within the region of interest.\n\n3. **Calculate the area of the region:**\n   The region of interest is a triangle in 3-dimensional space. The vertices of this triangle are $(25, 25, 25)$, $(25, 0, 0)$, and $(0, 25, 0)$. The area of a triangle in 3-dimensional space is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{6} \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 25 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 25 & 25 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right|\n   \\]\n   Calculating the determinant:\n   \\[\n   \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 25 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 25 & 25 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 1 \\cdot (0 \\cdot 0 - 0 \\cdot 0) - 1 \\cdot (25 \\cdot 0 - 25 \\cdot 0) + 1 \\cdot (25 \\cdot 0 - 0 \\cdot 0) = 0\n   \\]\n   Since the determinant is zero, the area of the region is zero.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The area of the region of interest is $0$, so $a = 0$ and $b = 1$. Therefore, $a + b = 0 + 1 = \\boxed{1}$.",

Let $X = (x, y)$. Then:\n   \\[\n   f(X) = 14x + 7y + 24x + 13y + 26x\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   f(X) = (14 + 24 + 26)x + (7 + 13)y = 64x + 20y\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the minimum value of $f(X)$:**\n   To find the minimum value of $f(X)$, we need to minimize $64x + 20y$. We can rewrite this as:\n   \\[\n   64x + 20y = 20(3x + y)\n   \\]\n   To minimize $3x + y$, we need to find the line that is tangent to the ellipse defined by $3x + y = 0$.

Substituting $y = -3x$ into $3x + y = 0$, we get:\n   \\[\n   3x - 3x = 0 \\implies 0 = 0\n   \\]\n   This is always true, so any point on the line $y = -3x$ will satisfy the ellipse equation.

      "generated_solution": "1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have a $2 \\times 2$ grid of unit squares.\n   - Each unit square has 2 red sides and 2 blue sides.\n   - We need to find the number of ways to color the 12 unit line segments (sides of the squares) such that each square has 2 red sides and 2 blue sides.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Grid:**\n   - The grid is a $2 \\times 2$ grid, which means there are 4 unit squares.\n   - Each square has 4 sides, and each side is either red or blue.\n   - Each square must have 2 red sides and 2 blue sides.\n\n3. **Counting the Total Number of Colorings:**\n   - Each side of the grid can be colored in 2 ways (red or blue).\n   - Since there are 12 sides, the total number of ways to color the sides is $2^{12}$.\n\n4. **Counting the Invalid Colorings:**\n   - A coloring is invalid if it does not meet the condition that each square has 2 red sides and 2 blue sides.\n   - We need to count the number of invalid colorings.\n\n5. **Counting Invalid Colorings:**\n   - Consider the top-left square. It has 4 sides, and each side can be colored in 2 ways.\n   - The number of ways to color the top-left square is $2^4$.\n   - Similarly, the number of ways to color the top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right squares is also $2^4$.\n   - The total number of ways to color all four squares is $2^4 \\times 2^4 \\times 2^4 \\times 2^4 = 2^{16}$.\n\n6. **Calculating the Valid Colorings:**\n   - The total number of colorings is $2^{12}$.\n   - The number of invalid colorings is $2^{16}$.\n   - The number of valid colorings is $2^{12} - 2^{16}$.\n\n7. **Simplifying the Expression:**\n   - We need to simplify $2^{12} - 2^{16}$.\n   - Using the difference of powers formula, $a^m - a^n = a^{m-n}(a^n - 1)$, we get:\n     \\[\n     2^{12} - 2^{16} = 2^{12}(1 - 2^4) = 2^{12}(1 - 16) = 2^{12} \\times (-15)\n     \\]\n   - Since $2^{12} = 4096$, we have:\n     \\[\n     2^{12} \\times (-15) = 4096 \\times (-15) = -61440\n     \\]\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of valid colorings is $-61440$.\n   - Since the number of colorings must be a non-negative integer, we need to adjust the calculation.\n   - The correct calculation should be:\n     \\[\n     2^{12} - 2^{16} = 4096 - 65536 = -61440\n     \\]\n   - However, this result is incorrect because it is negative. We need to correct the calculation.\n\n9. **Correcting the Calculation:**\n   - The correct calculation should be:\n     \\[\n     2^{12} - 2^{16} = 4096 - 65536 = -61440\n     \\]\n   - This result is incorrect because it is negative.
