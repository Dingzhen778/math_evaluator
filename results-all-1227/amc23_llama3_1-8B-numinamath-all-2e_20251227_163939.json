We need to find the probability that at some point her running total equals 3.\n\n2. **Total Possible Outcomes:**\n   Each roll of the die has 6 possible outcomes. Since she rolls the die 4 times, the total number of outcomes is:\n   \\[\n   6^4 = 1296\n   \\]\n\n3. **Favorable Outcomes:**\n   We need to count the number of ways Janet can achieve a running total of 3 at some point during the 4 rolls. We consider the following cases:\n\n   - **Case 1: Total of 3 in the first roll:**\n     There is only 1 way to achieve this: rolling a 3.\n\n   - **Case 2: Total of 3 in the second roll:**\n     To achieve a total of 3 in the second roll, the first roll must be a 0. There is only 1 way to achieve this: rolling a 0.\n\n   - **Case 3: Total of 3 in the third roll:**\n     To achieve a total of 3 in the third roll, the first two rolls must sum to 0. There are 2 ways to achieve this: rolling a 0 and a 0, or a 6 and a 6.\n\n   - **Case 4: Total of 3 in the fourth roll:**\n     To achieve a total of 3 in the fourth roll, the first three rolls must sum to 0. There are 3 ways to achieve this: rolling a 0, 0, and 0; a 6, 6, and 0; or a 6, 0, and 6.\n\n4. **Total Favorable Outcomes:**\n   Adding up all the favorable outcomes:\n   \\[\n   1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7\n   \\]\n\n5. **Probability Calculation:**\n   The probability that Janet's running total equals 3 at some point is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7}{1296}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Simplifying the Fraction:**\n   The fraction \\(\\frac{7}{1296}\\) is already in its simplest form since 7 and 1296 have no common factors other than 1.\n\n7. **Final Answer:**\n   The final answer is \\(m = 7\\) and \\(n = 1296\\), so \\(m + n = 7 + 1296 = 1303\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1303}\n\\]",

Given that the smallest side has length 6, we have:\n   \\[\n   a - d = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Use the angle bisector theorem:**\n   The angle bisector theorem states that the angle bisector of a triangle divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the adjacent sides. Given that one of the angles is \\(120^\\circ\\), the angle bisector divides the opposite side into two segments that are in the ratio \\(1:2\\).

Each die can show any number from 1 to 6, so the product of the numbers on the dice can range from \\( 1 \\times 1 \\times \\cdots \\times 1 = 1 \\) to \\( 6 \\times 6 \\times \\cdots \\times 6 = 6^n \\).\n\n2. **Identifying the Range of Possible Products:**\n   The product of the numbers on the dice can take any value from 1 to \\( 6^n \\). Therefore, we need to find \\( n \\) such that there are 936 possible values in this range.\n\n3. **Calculating the Number of Possible Products:**\n   The number of possible products is given by the number of integers from 1 to \\( 6^n \\). This is equivalent to the number of integers in the set \\( \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 6^n\\} \\), which is \\( 6^n \\).\n\n4. **Setting Up the Equation:**\n   We need \\( 6^n = 936 \\). To find \\( n \\), we solve the equation:\n   \\[\n   6^n = 936\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solving the Equation:**\n   We can rewrite 936 as a power of 6:\n   \\[\n   936 = 6^2 \\times 13\n   \\]\n   Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   6^n = 6^2 \\times 13\n   \\]\n   This implies:\n   \\[\n   n = 2 + 1 = 3\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   The value of \\( n \\) that allows the product of the numbers rolled on \\( n \\) dice to take any of the 936 possible values is \\( n = 3 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]",

We will analyze the problem by considering the worst-case scenario where the rectangle is placed in such a way that it covers the least number of squares.\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have a $3 \\times 3$ grid of squares, and a $2 \\times 1$ rectangle can be placed in 6 different ways (3 horizontal and 3 vertical). We are not told which two squares are covered by the rectangle, so we need to make guesses to find at least one covered square.\n\n2. **Worst-case Scenario**: Suppose the rectangle is placed in such a way that it covers the top two squares in the first column. This means the rectangle covers the squares at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2). The remaining squares are (1,3), (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3).\n\n3. **First Turn**: If we guess the square at position (1,3), we are told whether it is covered or not. If it is not covered, then the rectangle must be in one of the remaining 5 positions. If it is covered, then the rectangle is in one of the 3 positions that include (1,3).\n\n4. **Second Turn**: If the first guess was not covered, we have 5 remaining positions for the rectangle. If the first guess was covered, we have 3 remaining positions. In either case, we can now guess another square to further narrow down the possibilities.\n\n5. **Third Turn**: After the second guess, we will have at most 3 remaining positions for the rectangle. We can now guess a third square to ensure that at least one of the squares is covered by the rectangle.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: By making three guesses, we can ensure that at least one of the guessed squares is covered by the rectangle in the worst-case scenario.

The diagonals of the rhombus are \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) and \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\). The area \\(A\\) of the rhombus is:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times d_1 \\times d_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 6 = 18\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   The area of the region in the coordinate plane defined by the given inequality is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{18}\n   \\]",
