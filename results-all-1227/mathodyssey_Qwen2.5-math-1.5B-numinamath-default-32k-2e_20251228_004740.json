Therefore, $f(x) = [x[x]]] = [x \\cdot 0] = [0] = 0$.\n   - For $x \\in [1, 2)$, we have $[x] = 1$. Therefore, $f(x) = [x[x]]] = [x \\cdot 1] = [x] = 1$.\n   - For $x \\in [2, 3)$, we have $[x] = 2$. Therefore, $f(x) = [x[x]]] = [x \\cdot 2] = [2x]$. Since $x \\in [2, 3)$, we have $2x \\in [4, 6)$. Therefore, $[2x] = 4$.\n   - For $x \\in [3, 4)$, we have $[x] = 3$. Therefore, $f(x) = [x[x]]] = [x \\cdot 3] = [3x]$. Since $x \\in [3, 4)$, we have $3x \\in [9, 12)$. Therefore, $[3x] = 9$.\n   - For $x \\in [4, 5)$, we have $[x] = 4$. Therefore, $f(x) = [x[x]]] = [x \\cdot 4] = [4x]$. Since $x \\in [4, 5)$, we have $4x \\in [16, 20)$. Therefore, $[4x] = 16$.\n   - For $x \\in [5, 6)$, we have $[x] = 5$. Therefore, $f(x) = [x[x]]] = [x \\cdot 5] = [5x]$. Since $x \\in [5, 6)$, we have $5x \\in [25, 30)$. Therefore, $[5x] = 25$.\n   - For $x \\in [6, 7)$, we have $[x] = 6$. Therefore, $f(x) = [x[x]]] = [x \\cdot 6] = [6x]$. Since $x \\in [6, 7)$, we have $6x \\in [36, 42)$. Therefore, $[6x] = 36$.\n   - For $x \\in [7, 8)$, we have $[x] = 7$. Therefore, $f(x) = [x[x]]] = [x \\cdot 7] = [7x]$. Since $x \\in [7, 8)$, we have $7x \\in [49, 56)$. Therefore, $[7x] = 49$.\n   - For $x \\in [8, 9)$, we have $[x] = 8$. Therefore, $f(x) = [x[x]]] = [x \\cdot 8] = [8x]$. Since $x \\in [8, 9)$, we have $8x \\in [64, 72)$. Therefore, $[8x] = 64$.\n   - For $x \\in [9, 10)$, we have $[x] = 9$. Therefore, $f(x) = [x[x]]] = [x \\cdot 9] = [9x]$. Since $x \\in [9, 10)$, we have $9x \\in [81, 90)$. Therefore, $[9x] = 81$.\n   - For $x \\in [10, 11)$, we have $[x] = 10$. Therefore, $f(x) = [x[x]]] = [x \\cdot 10] = [10x]$. Since $x \\in [10, 11)$, we have $10x \\in [100, 110)$. Therefore, $[10x] = 100$.\n\n3. **Counting the Number of Elements in the Range Set of $f(x)$:**\n\n   From the above analysis, we can see that the range of $f(x)$ consists of the following values: $0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100$.\n\n   Therefore, the number of elements in the range set of $f(x)$ when $x \\in [0, n)$ is $a_n = 15$ for $n \\geq 10$.\n\n4. **Finding the Minimum Value of $\\frac{a_n + 90}{n}}$:**\n\n   We have $a_n = 15$ for $n \\geq 10$. Therefore, we need to find the minimum value of $\\frac{15 + 90}{n}} = \\frac{105}{n}}$ for $n \\geq 10$.\n\n   The function $\\frac{105}{n}}$ is a decreasing function of $n$. Therefore, the minimum value of $\\frac{105}{n}}$ for $n \\geq 10$ occurs when $n = 10$.\n\n   Therefore, the minimum value of $\\frac{a_n + 90}{n}}$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{105}{10}} = 10.5}$.",

For a natural number $n$, $\\varphi(n)$ is the number of positive integers less than or equal to $n$ that are coprime to $n$.\n\nGiven that $\\varphi(pq) = 3p + q$, we can use the properties of the Euler's totient function to find the values of $p$ and $q$.\n\nSince $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers, we can use the formula for the Euler's totient function for a product of two distinct prime numbers:\n\n$$\\varphi(pq) = (p-1)(q-1)$$\n\nSubstituting this into the given equation, we get:\n\n$$(p-1)(q-1) = 3p + q$$\n\nExpanding the left-hand side, we get:\n\n$$pq - p - q + 1 = 3p + q$$\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n$$pq - 4p - 2q + 1 = 0$$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of $p$ and $q$.

The initial term $S_1$ is given as $\\{1, 1\\}$. For $S_2$, we take the elements of $S_1$ and add them in pairs, resulting in $\\{1, 2, 1\\}$.

This is because each term in $S_n$ is either a term from $S_{n-1}}$ or a sum of two terms from $S_{n-1}}$.\n\n3. **Counting the Number of Terms Equal to $1988$:**\n\n   To find the number of terms equal to $1988$ in $S_{1988}$, we need to analyze the structure of the sequence and how the terms are generated.\n\n   - **Base Case:** For $S_1$, there are no terms equal to $1988$.\n   - **Inductive Step:** Assume that for $S_k$, the number of terms equal to $1988$ is $N_k$. We need to determine the number of terms equal to $1988$ in $S_{k+1}$.\n\n     According to the construction of the sequence, each term in $S_{k+1}$ is either a term from $S_k$ or a sum of two terms from $S_k$. Therefore, the number of terms equal to $1988$ in $S_{k+1}$ is the sum of the number of terms equal to $1988$ in $S_k$ and the number of terms equal to $1988$ in $S_k$.\n\n     This gives us the recurrence relation:\n     \\[\n     N_{k+1} = 2N_k\n     \\]\n\n     Using this recurrence relation, we can determine the number of terms equal to $1988$ in $S_{1988}$.\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n\n   After analyzing the sequence and applying the recurrence relation, we find that the number of terms equal to $1988$ in $S_{1988}$ is $\\boxed{1988}$.",

Thus, $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$ or $k \\equiv 3 \\pmod{2}$.\n\n4. **Count the number of valid $\\alpha$ values:**\n   Since $|\\\\alpha| \\\\leq 2005$, we have:\n   \\[\n   -2005 \\leq \\alpha \\leq 2005\n   \\]\n   The number of integers $k$ such that $k^2 - 5$ is divisible by 4 is the number of integers $k$ such that $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$ or $k \\equiv 3 \\pmod{2}$ within the range $-2005 \\leq k \\leq 2005$.\n\n   The number of such $k$ values is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 2005 = 4010\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of values of $\\alpha$ that make the system of equations have integer solutions is $\\boxed{4010}$.",

To do this, we need to apply a rotation transformation to the coordinates of the highest point.\n\nThe rotation transformation for a point $(x, y)$ rotated by an angle $\\theta$ about the origin is given by:\n\n$$x' = x \\cos \\theta - y \\sin \\theta$$\n$$y' = x \\sin \\theta + y \\cos \\theta$$\n\nIn our case, the angle of rotation is $\\theta = 45$ degrees, which is equivalent to $\\theta = \\\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$ radians.

It is also impossible to find four people on the spot who have three identical choices but differ pairwise in the fourth choice.\n\nLet's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Constraints:**\n   - The first constraint implies that no two people can have the exact same combination of appetizers, main courses, desserts, and wines.\n   - The second constraint implies that no four people can have exactly three dishes in common and the fourth dish differing between each pair of these four people.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Problem:**\n   - We need to find the maximum number of guests such that the constraints are satisfied.\n   - The constraints suggest that the choices of the dishes must be carefully selected to avoid any two people having the exact same combination of dishes.\n\n3. **Constructing a Solution:**\n   - To satisfy the constraints, we can consider a combinatorial approach where each guest's choice of dishes is unique and satisfies the given constraints.\n   - One way to ensure that the constraints are satisfied is to use a combinatorial design known as a \"Steiner system.\" A Steiner system \\( S(t, k, v) \\) is a collection of \\( k \\)-element subsets (blocks) of a \\( v \\)-element set such that every \\( t \\)-element subset of the \\( v \\)-element set is contained in exactly one block.\n\n4. **Applying the Steiner System:**\n   - In our problem, we have 9 types of each dish (appetizers, main courses, desserts, and wines).\n   - We need to find a Steiner system \\( S(3, 4, 9) \\), which means we need to find a collection of 4-element subsets of a 9-element set such that every 3-element subset of the 9-element set is contained in exactly one 4-element subset.\n\n5. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Guests:**\n   - The number of 3-element subsets of a 9-element set is given by the binomial coefficient \\( \\binom{9}{3}} \\).\n   - The number of 4-element subsets of a 9-element set is given by the binomial coefficient \\( \\binom{9}{4}} \\).\n   - The maximum number of guests is the number of 4-element subsets of a 9-element set, which is \\( \\binom{9}{4}} \\).\n\n6. **Final Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{9}{4}} = \\frac{9!}{4!(9-4)!}} = \\frac{9!}{4!5!}} = \\frac{9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 126\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of guests that can be at the dinner party while satisfying the given constraints is \\(\\boxed{126}\\).",

So, the initial cost is 2 coins.\n\n2. **Second Door**: After opening the first door, Xiao Ming can see the second door. Upon opening the second door, two equally likely options appear: either return to the outside of the first door or proceed to the third door.\n\n3. **Third Door**: Upon opening the third door, three equally likely options appear: either return to the outside of the first door, stay in place and need to reopen the third door, or pass the game.\n\nTo pass the game, Xiao Ming needs to avoid the third door. This means he needs to either return to the outside of the first door or stay in place and need to reopen the third door.\n\nLet's calculate the expected number of coins Xiao Ming will spend to pass the game.\n\n- **Probability of Passing the Game**: The probability of passing the game is the probability of not opening the third door. Since there are three equally likely options, the probability of passing the game is $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\n- **Expected Number of Coins**: The expected number of coins Xiao Ming will spend to pass the game is the sum of the initial cost and the expected number of coins spent on the second and third doors.\n\nThe expected number of coins spent on the second and third doors is the sum of the probabilities of each option multiplied by the cost of that option.\n\n- **Cost of Returning to the First Door**: The cost of returning to the first door is 2 coins (for opening the first door) plus 2 coins (for opening the second door) plus 2 coins (for opening the third door) plus 2 coins (for returning to the first door). So, the cost of returning to the first door is $2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10$ coins.\n\n- **Cost of Staying in Place and Needing to Reopen the Third Door**: The cost of staying in place and needing to reopen the third door is 2 coins (for opening the first door) plus 2 coins (for opening the second door) plus 2 coins (for opening the third door) plus 2 coins (for staying in place and needing to reopen the third door).

The problem states that we can swap two elements at most 4 times to obtain a permutation $C$ from the permutation $1, 2, \\ldots, 9$.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to recognize that the number of swaps required to transform one permutation into another is related to the number of inversions in the permutation. An inversion in a permutation is a pair of elements that are out of their natural order.\n\nGiven that we can perform at most 4 swaps, we need to consider the maximum number of inversions that can be resolved with 4 swaps. Each swap can resolve at most 2 inversions (since swapping two elements can correct at most 2 inversions).\n\nTherefore, with 4 swaps, we can resolve at most $4 \\times 2 = 8$ inversions. This means that the permutation $C$ can have at most 8 inversions.\n\nNow, we need to count the number of permutations of $1, 2, \\ldots, 9$ that have at most 8 inversions. This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved using various techniques, such as generating functions or dynamic programming.\n\nHowever, the exact solution to this problem is not straightforward and requires a deep understanding of combinatorial mathematics. Therefore, I will not provide the exact solution to this problem, but I will encourage you to explore the problem further and to seek help from experts in combinatorial mathematics if you need assistance.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{The exact number of permutations satisfying the condition is not straightforward to determine and requires a deep understanding of combinatorial mathematics.}}}$",

However, without specific numerical methods or graphing tools, it is difficult to definitively conclude the number of real roots.\n\nGiven the complexity of the function and the difficulty in determining the exact number of real roots without numerical methods, we cannot definitively confirm or deny Statement I.\n\n### Statement II: \\( f(x) \\) has three imaginary roots.\n\nTo determine the nature of the roots, we can use the fact that a polynomial of degree \\( n \\) has exactly \\( n \\) roots (counting multiplicities).\n\n1. **Degree of the Polynomial:**\n   The polynomial \\( f(x) \\) is of degree 5.\n\n2. **Number of Real and Imaginary Roots:**\n   Since the polynomial is of odd degree, it must have at least one real root. The remaining roots can be either real or imaginary.\n\nGiven that the polynomial is of degree 5, it must have exactly 5 roots (counting multiplicities). If there are three imaginary roots, then there must be two real roots (since the total number of roots must be 5).\n\nHowever, without specific numerical methods or graphing tools, it is difficult to definitively conclude the nature of the roots.\n\n### Statement III: \\( f(x) \\) has a double root.\n\nTo determine if the polynomial has a double root, we can use the fact that a double root occurs when both the function and its first derivative are zero at the same point.\n\n1. **Finding the Double Root:**\n   To find a double root, we need to solve the system of equations:\n   \\[\n   f(x) = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   f'(x) = 0\n   \\]\n\nWithout specific numerical methods or graphing tools, it is difficult to definitively conclude the existence of a double root.\n\n### Statement IV: As \\( x \\to \\infty, f(x) \\to \\infty \\).\n\nTo determine the behavior of the function as \\( x \\to \\infty \\), we can use the leading term of the polynomial.\n\n1. **Leading Term:**\n   The leading term of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( x^5 \\).\n\n2. **Behavior as \\( x \\to \\infty \\):**\n   As \\( x \\to \\infty \\), the term \\( x^5 \\) will dominate the behavior of the function.

Therefore, we have:\n\\[\\omega^2 + g'(0) = 0\\]\n\nSince $g'(0) > 0$, we can conclude that $\\omega^2 < 0$, which is not possible since $\\omega^2$ is always non-negative.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium $x(t) = 0$ is $\\boxed{\\text{unstable}}}$ for the given autonomous ODE.",

We can also ignore $q(1)$ because we are trying to find $q(1)$.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n$$q(2) = \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{2} q(1) + \\\\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n$$q(2) = 1 + \\\\frac{1}{2} q(1)$$\n\nNow, we can use the equation to find $q(3)$:\n$$q(3) = \\\\frac{1}{2} q(5) + \\\\frac{1}{2} q(2) + \\\\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nSince $q(5)$ is not defined (because we cannot reach state 5 from state 3), we can ignore it. We can also ignore $q(2)$ because we are trying to find $q(1)$.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n$$q(3) = \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{2} q(1) + \\\\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n$$q(3) = 1 + \\\\frac{1}{2} q(1)$$\n\nNow, we can use the equation to find $q(1)$:\n$$q(1) = \\\\frac{1}{2} q(3) + \\\\frac{1}{2} q(0) + \\\\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nSubstituting the values we found for $q(3)$ and $q(0)$, we get:\n$$q(1) = \\\\frac{1}{2} (1 + \\\\frac{1}{2} q(1)) + \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n$$q(1) = \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{4} q(1) + \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n$$q(1) = \\\\frac{3}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{4} q(1)$$\n\nSubtracting $\\frac{1}{4} q(1)}$ from both sides, we get:\n$$\\\\frac{3}{4} q(1) = \\\\frac{3}{2}$$\n\nDividing both sides by $\\frac{3}{4}}$, we get:\n$$q(1) = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{4}{3} = 2$$\n\nTherefore, the probability of ever reaching state 0 starting at $x=1$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
