      "generated_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Janet's running total equals 3 at some point during her four rolls of a standard 6-sided die.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the possible outcomes for each roll:**\n   Each roll of a 6-sided die can result in one of the numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n\n2. **Determine the running total after each roll:**\n   Let \\( S_n \\) represent the running total after \\( n \\) rolls. We need to find the probability that \\( S_n = 3 \\) for some \\( n \\) in the range \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 4 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the probability of reaching a running total of 3:**\n   - **After 1 roll:** The only way to get a running total of 3 is to roll a 3. The probability of this happening is:\n     \\[\n     P(S_1 = 3) = \\frac{1}{6}}\n     \\]\n\n   - **After 2 rolls:** The running total can be 3 if the sum of the two rolls is 3. The possible pairs of rolls that sum to 3 are (1, 2) and (2, 1). The probability of each pair occurring is:\n     \\[\n     P(S_2 = 3) = 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{6}} \\times \\frac{1}{6}\\right) = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{36}} = \\frac{1}{18}}\n     \\]\n\n   - **After 3 rolls:** The running total can be 3 if the sum of the three rolls is 3. The possible triples of rolls that sum to 3 are (1, 1, 1). The probability of this happening is:\n     \\[\n     P(S_3 = 3) = \\left(\\frac{1}{6}}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{216}}\n     \\]\n\n   - **After 4 rolls:** The running total can be 3 if the sum of the four rolls is 3. The possible quadruples of rolls that sum to 3 are (1, 1, 1, 0) and permutations thereof. However, since the die only has faces from 1 to 6, it is impossible to achieve a sum of 3 with four rolls.
