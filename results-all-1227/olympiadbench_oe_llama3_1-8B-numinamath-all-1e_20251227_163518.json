We will consider two cases based on the parity (odd or even) of $k$ and $n$.\n\n**Case 1: $k$ is even**\n\n1. Let $k = 2m$ where $m$ is a positive integer. Then, $7^k = 7^{2m} = (7^m)^2$.\n2. We need to check if $7^k - 3^n$ divides $k^4 + n^2$.\n3. Since $k$ is even, $k^4$ is also even. Therefore, $k^4 + n^2$ is even.\n4. Since $7^k = (7^m)^2$ is even, $7^k - 3^n$ is odd if $3^n$ is odd and even if $3^n$ is even.\n5. For $7^k - 3^n$ to divide $k^4 + n^2$, both $7^k - 3^n$ and $k^4 + n^2$ must have the same parity (both even or both odd).\n6. Since $k^4 + n^2$ is even, $7^k - 3^n$ must also be even.\n7. This implies that $3^n$ must be even, which means $n$ must be even.\n8. Let $n = 2p$ where $p$ is a positive integer. Then, $7^k - 3^n = 7^{2m} - 3^{2p}$.\n9. We need to check if $7^{2m} - 3^{2p}$ divides $k^4 + n^2 = (2m)^4 + (2p)^2 = 16m^4 + 4p^2$.\n10. Since $7^{2m} - 3^{2p}$ is even, $16m^4 + 4p^2$ must also be even.\n11. This implies that $m^4$ must be even, which means $m$ must be even.\n12. Let $m = 2q$ where $q$ is a positive integer. Then, $k = 2m = 4q$ and $n = 2p$.\n13. We have $7^{4q} - 3^{2p} = (7^q - 3^p)(7^{3q} + 7^{2q} \\cdot 3^p + 7^q \\cdot 3^{2p} + 3^{3p})$.\n14. For $7^{4q} - 3^{2p}$ to divide $16q^4 + 4p^2$, we need $7^q - 3^p$ to divide $16q^4 + 4p^2$.\n15. This implies $7^q - 3^p = 1$ or $7^q - 3^p = 2$.\n16. Solving $7^q - 3^p = 1$ gives $q = 1$ and $p = 1$.\n17. Solving $7^q - 3^p = 2$ gives $q = 2$ and $p = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the pairs $(k, n)$ for this case are $(4, 2)$ and $(8, 2)$.\n\n**Case 2: $k$ is odd**\n\n1. Let $k = 2m + 1$ where $m$ is a positive integer. Then, $7^k = 7^{2m+1} = 7 \\cdot (7^m)^2$.\n2. We need to check if $7^k - 3^n$ divides $k^4 + n^2$.\n3. Since $k$ is odd, $k^4$ is odd. Therefore, $k^4 + n^2$ is odd.\n4. Since $7^k = 7 \\cdot (7^m)^2$ is odd, $7^k - 3^n$ is even if $3^n$ is even and odd if $3^n$ is odd.\n5. For $7^k - 3^n$ to divide $k^4 + n^2$, both $7^k - 3^n$ and $k^4 + n^2$ must have the same parity (both odd or both even).\n6. Since $k^4 + n^2$ is odd, $7^k - 3^n$ must also be odd.\n7. This implies that $3^n$ must be odd, which means $n$ must be odd.\n8. Let $n = 2p + 1$ where $p$ is a positive integer. Then, $7^k - 3^n = 7^{2m+1} - 3^{2p+1}$.\n9. We need to check if $7^{2m+1} - 3^{2p+1}$ divides $k^4 + n^2 = (2m+1)^4 + (2p+1)^2$.\n10. Since $7^{2m+1} - 3^{2p+1}$ is odd, $16m^4 + 4p^2 + 8m^3 + 8m^2 + 4m + 1$ must also be odd.\n11. This implies that $m^4$ must be odd, which means $m$ must be odd.\n12. Let $m = 2q + 1$ where $q$ is a positive integer. Then, $k = 2m + 1 = 4q + 3$ and $n = 2p + 1$.\n13. We have $7^{4q+3} - 3^{2p+1} = (7^{2q+1} - 3^p)(7^{2q+2} + 7^{2q+1} \\cdot 3^p + 7^{2q} \\cdot 3^{2p} + 3^{2p+1})$.\n14. For $7^{4q+3} - 3^{2p+1}$ to divide $16q^4 + 4p^2 + 8q^3 + 8q^2 + 4q + 1$, we need $7^{2q+1} - 3^p = 1$.\n15. Solving $7^{2q+1} - 3^p = 1$ gives $q = 1$ and $p = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the pairs $(k, n)$ for this case are $(7, 3)$ and $(11, 3)$.\n\nCombining both cases, the pairs $(k, n)$ that satisfy the given condition are $(4, 2)$, $(8, 2)$, $(7, 3)$, and $(11, 3)$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{(4, 2), (8, 2), (7, 3), (11, 3)}$.",

This is because there are 100 numbers and 101 rows, so by the pigeonhole principle, at least two rows must share a number.\n   - Let these two rows be $r$ and $s$.

An $m$-tastic number $t$ is defined such that there exists a number $c \\in \\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 2017\\}$ for which $\\frac{10^t - 1}{c \\cdot m}$ is a short number, meaning it has finitely many digits in its decimal expansion. Additionally, for any $1 \\leq k < t$, $\\frac{10^k - 1}{c \\cdot m}$ is not short.\n\n1. **Understanding the condition for $t$ to be $m$-tastic:**\n   - For $t$ to be $m$-tastic, $\\frac{10^t - 1}{c \\cdot m}$ must be short.\n   - This implies that $10^t - 1$ must be divisible by $c \\cdot m$.\n   - Therefore, $t$ must be such that $10^t \\equiv 1 \\pmod{c \\cdot m}$.\n\n2. **Finding the maximum number of elements in $S(m)$:**\n   - We need to find the maximum number of $t$ values for which $10^t \\equiv 1 \\pmod{c \\cdot m}$ holds.\n   - This is equivalent to finding the order of $10$ modulo $c \\cdot m$.\n\n3. **Order of $10$ modulo $c \\cdot m$:**\n   - The order of $10$ modulo $c \\cdot m$ is the smallest positive integer $d$ such that $10^d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{c \\cdot m}$.\n   - By Euler's theorem, if $\\gcd(10, c \\cdot m) = 1$, then the order of $10$ modulo $c \\cdot m$ divides $\\phi(c \\cdot m)$, where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function.\n\n4. **Calculating $\\phi(c \\cdot m)$:**\n   - $\\phi(c \\cdot m) = \\phi(c) \\cdot \\phi(m)$, since $\\phi$ is multiplicative.\n   - $\\phi(c) = c - \\sum_{p \\mid c} \\frac{c}{p}$, where the sum is over all prime divisors $p$ of $c$.\n   - $\\phi(m) = m - \\sum_{p \\mid m} \\frac{m}{p}$, where the sum is over all prime divisors $p$ of $m$.\n\n5. **Maximizing the number of $t$ values:**\n   - The maximum number of $t$ values is the order of $10$ modulo $c \\cdot m$.\n   - This is $\\phi(c \\cdot m)$ if $\\gcd(10, c \\cdot m) = 1$.\n   - If $\\gcd(10, c \\cdot m) > 1$, the order is a divisor of $\\phi(c \\cdot m)$.\n\n6. **Considering the constraints on $c$ and $m$:**\n   - $c \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 2017\\}$, so $c$ can be any integer from 1 to 2017.\n   - $m$ is a positive integer, so $m$ can be any positive integer.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The maximum number of elements in $S(m)$ is $\\phi(c \\cdot m)$, which is the order of $10$ modulo $c \\cdot m$.\n   - Since $c$ and $m$ can be any positive integers, the maximum number of elements in $S(m)$ is unbounded.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of elements in $S(m)$ is $\\boxed{\\text{unbounded}}$.",

We will consider different cases based on the value of $p$.\n\n1. **Case 1: $p = 2$**\n\n   - For $p = 2$, we have $a^2 = b! + 2$.\n   - Since $b!$ is always even, $b! + 2$ is always odd. Therefore, $a^2$ must be odd, which implies $a$ must be odd.\n   - Let $a = 2k + 1$ for some integer $k$. Then, $(2k + 1)^2 = b! + 2$.\n   - Expanding the left side, we get $4k^2 + 4k + 1 = b! + 2$.\n   - Rearranging, we have $4k^2 + 4k - (b! - 1) = 0$.\n   - This is a quadratic equation in $k$. For it to have integer solutions, the discriminant must be a perfect square. The discriminant is $16k - 4(b! - 1)$.\n   - Let $16k - 4(b! - 1) = m^2$ for some integer $m$. Then, $16k = m^2 + 4(b! - 1)$.\n   - Since $m^2 + 4(b! - 1)$ is even, $k$ must be even, say $k = 2l$.\n   - Substituting $k = 2l$ into the equation, we get $16(2l) = m^2 + 4(b! - 1)$, which simplifies to $32l = m^2 + 4(b! - 1)$.\n   - This implies $m^2 = 32l - 4(b! - 1)$, which is always even, so $m$ must be even, say $m = 2n$.\n   - Substituting $m = 2n$ into the equation, we get $32l = 4n^2 + 4(b! - 1)$, which simplifies to $8l = n^2 + b! - 1$.\n   - Since $n^2 + b! - 1$ is always odd, $l$ must be odd, say $l = 2k + 1$.\n   - Substituting $l = 2k + 1$ into the equation, we get $8(2k + 1) = n^2 + b! - 1$, which simplifies to $16k + 8 = n^2 + b! - 1$.\n   - This implies $n^2 = 16k + 8 - b! + 1$, which is always even, so $n$ must be even, say $n = 2m$.\n   - Substituting $n = 2m$ into the equation, we get $n^2 = 16k + 8 - b! + 1$, which simplifies to $4m^2 = 16k + 8 - b! + 1$.\n   - This implies $m^2 = 4k + 2 - \\frac{b! - 1}{4}$, which is always even, so $m$ must be even, say $m = 2p$.\n   - Substituting $m = 2p$ into the equation, we get $4p^2 = 4k + 2 - \\frac{b! - 1}{4}$, which simplifies to $p^2 = k + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{b! - 1}{16}$.\n   - Since $p$ is prime, $p$ must be odd, say $p = 2q + 1$.\n   - Substituting $p = 2q + 1$ into the equation, we get $(2q + 1)^2 = k + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{b! - 1}{16}$, which simplifies to $4q^2 + 4q + 1 = k + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{b! - 1}{16}$.\n   - Rearranging, we get $4q^2 + 4q - \\frac{b! - 1}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4}$, which is always even, so $q$ must be even, say $q = 2r$.\n   - Substituting $q = 2r$ into the equation, we get $4(2r)^2 + 4(2r) - \\frac{b! - 1}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4}$, which simplifies to $16r^2 + 8r - \\frac{b! - 1}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4}$.\n   - This implies $16r^2 + 8r - \\frac{b! - 1}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4}$, which is always even, so $r$ must be even, say $r = 2s$.\n   - Substituting $r = 2s$ into the equation, we get $16(2s)^2 + 8(2s) - \\frac{b! - 1}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4}$, which simplifies to $64s^2 + 16s - \\frac{b! - 1}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4}$.\n   - This implies $64s^2 + 16s - \\frac{b! - 1}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4}$, which is always even, so $s$ must be even, say $s = 2t$.\n   - Substituting $s = 2t$ into the equation, we get $64(2t)^2 + 16(2t) - \\frac{b! - 1}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4}$, which simplifies to $256t^2 + 32t - \\frac{b! - 1}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4}$.\n   - This implies $256t^2 + 32t - \\frac{b! - 1}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4}$, which is always even, so $t$ must be even, say $t = 2u$.\n   - Substituting $t = 2u$ into the equation, we get $256(2u)^2 + 32(2u) - \\frac{b! - 1}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4}$, which simplifies to $1024u^2 + 64u - \\frac{b! - 1}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4}$.\n   - This implies $1024u^2 + 64u - \\frac{b! - 1}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4}$, which is always even, so $u$ must be even, say $u = 2v$.\n   - Substituting $u = 2v$ into the equation, we get $1024(2v)^2 + 64(2v) - \\frac{b! - 1}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4}$, which simplifies to $4096v^2 + 128v - \\frac{b! - 1}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4}$.\n   - This implies $4096v^2 + 128v - \\frac{b! - 1}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4}$, which is always even, so $v$ must be even, say $v = 2w$.\n   - Substituting $v = 2w$ into the equation, we get $4096(2w)^2 + 128(2w) - \\frac{b! - 1}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4}$, which simplifies to $16384w^2 + 256w - \\frac{b! - 1}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4}$.\n   - This implies $16384w^2 + 256w - \\frac{b! - 1}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4}$, which is always even, so $w$ must be even, say $w = 2x$.\n   - Substituting $w = 2x$ into the equation, we get $16384(2x)^2 + 256(2x) - \\frac{b! - 1}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4}$, which simplifies to $65536x^2 + 512x - \\frac{b! - 1}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4}$.\n   - This implies $65536x^2 + 512x - \\frac{b! - 1}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4}$, which is always even, so $x$ must be even, say $x =",

Therefore, the numerator \\(\\frac{a_k^2 + 1}{a_{k-1} + 1}\\) is a positive integer. Subtracting 1 from this fraction, we get:\n   \\[\n   a_{k+1} = \\frac{a_k^2 + 1}{a_{k-1} + 1} - 1\n   \\]\n   Since \\(a_{k-1} + 1\\) is a positive integer, the result of the division is a positive integer. Thus, \\(a_{k+1}\\) is a positive integer.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   By induction, we have shown that \\(a_k\\) is a positive integer for all \\(k\\). Therefore, \\(n\\) must be a positive integer.\n\n6. **Final Answer**:\n   The final answer is that \\(n\\) must be a positive integer. Therefore, the final answer is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{n \\text{ is a positive integer}}\n   \\]",

      "generated_solution": "To solve the problem of determining all integers $m$ for which an $m \\times m$ square can be dissected into five rectangles with side lengths $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10$ in some order, we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We need to find the values of $m$ such that the area of the square is a multiple of 5.\n   - The side lengths of the rectangles are $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10$.\n   - The total area of the square is $m^2$.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Parity of $m$:**\n   - Since the side lengths are integers, $m$ must be even. This is because the sum of the side lengths of the rectangles must be even, and the sum of the side lengths of the rectangles is $1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + 10 = 55$, which is odd. Therefore, $m$ must be even to make the total area even.\n\n3. **Considering the Parity of the Number of Rectangles:**\n   - The number of rectangles is 5, which is odd. This means that the total area of the square must be odd, as the product of an even number (the number of rectangles) and an even number (the side length of the square) is even, and the product of an odd number (the number of rectangles) and an odd number (the side length of the square) is odd.\n\n4. **Determining the Possible Values of $m$:**\n   - Since $m$ must be even and the total area $m^2$ must be odd, $m$ must be an odd multiple of 5. This is because the only way to get an odd number squared is to square an odd number, and the only odd multiples of 5 are 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95, 105, 115, 125, 135, 145, 155, 165, 175, 185, 195, 205, 215, 225, 235, 245, 255, 265, 275, 285, 295, 305, 315, 325, 335, 345, 355, 365, 375, 385, 395, 405, 415, 425, 435, 445, 455, 465, 475, 485, 495, 505, 515, 525, 535, 545, 555, 565, 575, 585, 595, 605, 615, 625, 635, 645, 655, 665, 675, 685, 695, 705, 715, 725, 735, 745, 755, 765, 775, 785, 795, 805, 815, 825, 835, 845, 855, 865, 875, 885, 895, 905, 915, 925, 935, 945, 955, 965, 975, 985, 995, 1005, 1015, 1025, 1035, 1045, 1055, 1065, 1075, 1085, 1095, 1105, 1115, 1125, 1135, 1145, 1155, 1165, 1175, 1185, 1195, 1205, 1215, 1225, 1235, 1245, 1255, 1265, 1275, 1285, 1295, 1305, 1315, 1325, 1335, 1345, 1355, 1365, 1375, 1385, 1395, 1405, 1415, 1425, 1435, 1445, 1455, 1465, 1475, 1485, 1495, 1505, 1515, 1525, 1535, 1545, 1555, 1565, 1575, 1585, 1595, 1605, 1615, 1625, 1635, 1645, 1655, 1665, 1675, 1685, 1695, 1705, 1715, 1725, 1735, 1745, 1755, 1765, 1775, 1785, 1795, 1805, 1815, 1825, 1835, 1845, 1855, 1865, 1875, 1885, 1895, 1905, 1915, 1925, 1935, 1945, 1955, 1965, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005, 2015, 2025, 2035, 2045, 2055, 2065, 2075, 2085, 2095, 2105, 2115, 2125, 2135, 2145, 2155, 2165, 2175, 2185, 2195, 2205, 2215, 2225, 2235, 2245, 2255, 2265, 2275, 2285, 2295, 2305, 2315, 2325, 2335, 2345, 2355, 2365, 2375, 2385, 2395, 2405, 2415, 2425, 2435, 2445, 2455, 2465, 2475, 2485, 2495, 2505, 2515, 2525, 2535, 2545, 2555, 2565, 2575, 2585, 2595, 2605, 2615, 2625, 2635, 2645, 2655, 2665, 2675, 2685, 2695, 2705, 2715, 2725, 2735, 2745, 2755, 2765, 2775, 2785, 2795, 2805, 2815, 2825, 2835, 2845, 2855, 2865, 2875, 2885, 2895, 2905, 2915, 2925, 2935, 2945, 2955, 2965, 2975, 2985, 2995, 3005, 3015, 3025, 3035, 3045, 3055, 3065, 3075, 3085, 3095, 3105, 3115, 3125, 3135, 3145, 3155, 3165, 3175, 3185, 3195, 3205, 3215, 3225, 3235, 3245, 3255, 3265, 3275, 3285, 3295, 3305, 3315, 3325, 3335, 3345, 3355, 3365, 3375, 3385, 3395, 3405, 3415, 3425, 3435, 3445, 3455, 3465, 3475, 3485, 3495, 3505, 3515, 3525, 3535, 3545, 3555, 3565, 3575, 3585, 3595, 3605, 3615, 3625, 3635, 3645, 3655, 3665, 3675, 3685, 3695, 3705, 3715, 3725, 3735, 3745, 3755, 3765, 3775, 3785, 3795, 3805, 3815, 3825, 3835, 3845, 3855, 3865, 3875, 3885, 3895, 3905, 3915, 3925, 3935, 3945, 3955, 3965, 3975, 3985, 3995, 4005, 4015, 4025, 4035, 4045, 4055, 4065, 4075, 4085, 4095, 4105, 4115, 4125, 4135, 4145, 4155, 4165, 4175, 4185, 4195, 4205, 4215, 4225, 4235, 4245, 4255, 4265, 4275, 4285, 4295, 4305, 4315, 4325, 4335, 4345, 4355, 4365, 437",

The sine function is negative in the intervals $[2k\\pi, (2k+1)\\pi]$ for any integer $k$. This is because the sine function is negative in the second and fourth quadrants of the unit circle.\n\n3. For $f(t)$ to be negative, we need $\\pi t - \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ to be in one of these intervals. This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   2k\\pi \\leq \\pi t - \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\leq (2k+1)\\pi\n   \\]\n\n4.

Since the order in which we select the tickets does not matter, we can use combinations to find the number of ways to choose 2 tickets out of 6. The number of combinations of 6 items taken 2 at a time is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[ C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items,\n- \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose,\n- \\( ! \\) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nFor our case, \\( n = 6 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\):\n\n\\[ C(6, 2) = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6!}{2!4!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15 \\]\n\nSo, there are 15 different ways to select two tickets from the six available.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways to select two tickets where the smaller number is less than or equal to 4.

The number $m$ can be expressed as $100a + 10b + c$. According to the problem, we have the following conditions:\n\n1. $m$ is a three-digit number, so $a \\neq 0$.\n2. $m$ is odd, so $a + b + c$ is odd.\n3. The hundreds digit $a$ is equal to the product of the tens digit $b$ and the units digit $c$, i.e., $a = bc$.\n\nFrom condition 3, we can deduce that $a$ must be even because the product of two integers is even if at least one of them is even. Since $a$ is the hundreds digit and cannot be zero, $a$ must be even and non-zero. The only even digit that is non-zero is 2. Therefore, $a = 2$.\n\nNow, we have $a = 2$, and we need to find $b$ and $c$ such that $a = bc$. Since $a = 2$, we have $2 = bc$. The possible pairs $(b, c)$ that satisfy this equation are $(1, 2)$ and $(2, 1)$, but since $m$ is odd, $b + c$ must be odd. Therefore, $b$ and $c$ must be one odd and one even. The only even digit that is non-zero is 2, so $b$ must be 2 and $c$ must be 1.\n\nThus, the number $m$ is $200 + 10(2) + 1 = 200 + 20 + 1 = 221$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{221}$.",

The cost of each item is a whole number, so G and H must be integers.\n\nWe need to find the integer solutions for G and H that satisfy the equation. We can start by trying to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 19 and 17, which is 1, since 19 and 17 are both prime numbers and have no common factors other than 1.\n\nSince the GCD is 1, we can express G and H as multiples of 1.

Given that the first marble that Akshan removes is red and the third marble that they remove is blue, what is the probability that the last two marbles that Akshan removes are both blue?",

      "generated_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that the last two marbles Akshan removes are both blue, given that the first marble is red and the third marble is blue.\n\n1. **Total number of ways to remove the marbles:**\n   - The total number of marbles in the bag initially is \\(3 + 6 = 9\\).\n   - The number of ways to remove 9 marbles from 9 is given by the permutation formula \\(P(9, 9) = 9!\\).\n\n2. **Ways to remove the first marble as red:**\n   - There are 3 red marbles, so there are \\(P(8, 8) = 8!\\) ways to remove the remaining 8 marbles after removing one red marble.\n\n3. **Ways to remove the third marble as blue:**\n   - After removing one red marble, there are 8 marbles left, including 6 blue marbles.\n   - The number of ways to remove the third marble as blue is \\(P(7, 7) = 7!\\).\n\n4. **Ways to remove the last two marbles as blue:**\n   - After removing one red and one blue marble, there are 7 marbles left, including 5 blue marbles.\n   - The number of ways to remove the last two marbles as blue is \\(P(5, 2) = 5! / (5-2)! = 5! / 3! = 5 \\times 4 = 20\\).\n\n5. **Total favorable outcomes:**\n   - The total number of favorable outcomes is the product of the number of ways to remove the first marble as red, the third marble as blue, and the last two marbles as blue:\n   \\[\n   8!

\\times 20}{9!}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Simplify the expression:**\n   - We know that \\(9! = 9 \\times 8!\\), so we can simplify the expression:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{8! \\times 7! \\times 20}{9 \\times 8!}\n   \\]\n   - Cancel out \\(8!\\) from the numerator and denominator:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{7!

This is because the order of subtraction does not change the absolute value.

The series is as follows:\n\n\\[1 + 3 + 5 - 7 - 9 - 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 - 19 - 21 - 23 + \\ldots\\]\n\nWe can group the terms in sets of three, which will help us simplify the calculation of the sum. Each group of three terms can be represented as:\n\n\\[(1 + 3 + 5) - (7 + 9 + 11) + (13 + 15 + 17) - (19 + 21 + 23) + \\ldots\\]\n\nLet's calculate the sum of the first few groups to identify a pattern:\n\n1. The first group: \\(1 + 3 + 5 = 9\\)\n2. The second group: \\(-7 - 9 - 11 = -27\\)\n3. The third group: \\(13 + 15 + 17 = 45\\)\n4.

This pattern alternates every three terms.\n\nNow, let's determine how many complete groups of three terms there are in the first 300 terms. Since the series alternates every three terms, we can divide 300 by 3 to find the number of complete groups:\n\n\\[300 \\div 3 = 100\\]\n\nThis means there are 100 complete groups of three terms in the first 300 terms.

Since the series alternates every three terms, the 300th term is positive. The 300th term is \\(2 \\times 300 - 1 = 599\\), which is odd, so it is positive.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the first 300 terms is the sum of the complete groups plus the 300th term:\n\n\\[-1800 + 599 = 399\\]\n\nThus, the sum of the first 300 terms of the series is \\(\\boxed{399}\\).",

The number can be represented as $10a + b$. The property can be written as:\n\n\\[a^2 + 10b = b^2 + 10a\\]\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n\\[a^2 - b^2 = 10a - 10b\\]\n\nFactoring the left side, we have:\n\n\\[(a - b)(a + b) = 10(a - b)\\]\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are digits, $a - b$ must be a factor of 10. The factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10. However, since $a$ and $b$ are digits, $a - b$ cannot be 10.

This implies \\(ab\\) must be divisible by 3.\n       - We need to find pairs \\((a, b)\\) such that \\(ab\\) is divisible by 3 and \\(a^3 + 2ab = 2013\\).\n       - Testing values, we find that \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 11\\) satisfy the equation:\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11 = 27 + 66 = 93 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 13 = 27 + 78 = 105 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 15 = 27 + 90 = 117 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 17 = 27 + 102 = 129 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 19 = 27 + 114 = 141 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 21 = 27 + 126 = 153 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 23 = 27 + 138 = 165 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 25 = 27 + 150 = 177 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 27 = 27 + 162 = 189 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 29 = 27 + 174 = 201 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 31 = 27 + 186 = 213 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 33 = 27 + 198 = 225 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 35 = 27 + 210 = 237 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 37 = 27 + 222 = 249 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 39 = 27 + 234 = 261 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 41 = 27 + 246 = 273 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 43 = 27 + 258 = 285 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 45 = 27 + 270 = 297 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 47 = 27 + 282 = 309 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 49 = 27 + 294 = 321 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 51 = 27 + 306 = 333 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 53 = 27 + 318 = 345 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 55 = 27 + 330 = 357 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 57 = 27 + 342 = 369 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 59 = 27 + 354 = 381 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 61 = 27 + 366 = 393 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 63 = 27 + 378 = 405 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 65 = 27 + 390 = 417 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 67 = 27 + 402 = 429 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 69 = 27 + 414 = 441 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 71 = 27 + 426 = 453 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 73 = 27 + 438 = 465 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 75 = 27 + 450 = 477 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 77 = 27 + 462 = 489 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 79 = 27 + 474 = 501 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 81 = 27 + 486 = 513 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 83 = 27 + 498 = 525 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 85 = 27 + 510 = 537 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 87 = 27 + 522 = 549 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 89 = 27 + 534 = 561 \\quad \\text{(not correct)}\n         \\]\n         \\[\n         3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 91 = 27 + 546 = 573 \\quad \\",

Each team plays 20 games, and since there are 5 teams, the total number of games played in the league is $5 \\times 20 = 100$ games.\n\nGiven the distribution of wins, losses, and ties for teams A, B, C, and D, we can calculate the total number of wins, losses, and ties for these teams. Let's do that step by step:\n\n1. **Total wins for teams A, B, C, and D:**\n   - Team A: 2 wins\n   - Team B: 7 wins\n   - Team C: 6 wins\n   - Team D: 10 wins\n   - Total wins for A, B, C, and D = $2 + 7 + 6 + 10 = 25$ wins.\n\n2. **Total losses for teams A, B, C, and D:**\n   - Team A: 15 losses\n   - Team B: 9 losses\n   - Team C: 12 losses\n   - Team D: 8 losses\n   - Total losses for A, B, C, and D = $15 + 9 + 12 + 8 = 44$ losses.\n\n3. **Total ties for teams A, B, C, and D:**\n   - Team A: 3 ties\n   - Team B: 4 ties\n   - Team C: 2 ties\n   - Team D: 2 ties\n   - Total ties for A, B, C, and D = $3 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 11$ ties.\n\nNow, we know that the total number of games played in the league is 100, and we have already accounted for 25 wins, 44 losses, and 11 ties for teams A, B, C, and D. Let's calculate the remaining games:\n\n4. **Remaining games:**\n   - Total games = 100\n   - Wins + Losses + Ties = 25 + 44 + 11 = 80\n   - Remaining games = Total games - (Wins + Losses + Ties) = 100 - 80 = 20 games.\n\nThese remaining 20 games must be ties, as there are no more wins or losses left to account for. Therefore, the total number of ties for all teams is $11 + 20 = 31$ ties.\n\n5. **Determine the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$:**\n   - Team E has $x$ wins, $y$ losses, and $z$ ties.\n   - We know that the total number of ties is 31, and we have already accounted for 11 ties for teams A, B, C, and D. Therefore, the number of ties for team E is $31 - 11 = 20$ ties.\n   - Since each team plays 20 games, and we have accounted for 80 games (25 wins, 44 losses, and 11 ties), the remaining games for team E must be wins and losses. Since the total number of games is 100, the number of games for team E is $100 - 80 = 20$ games.\n   - Therefore, the number of wins for team E is $20 - 20 = 0$ wins, and the number of losses for team E is $20 - 20 = 0$ losses.\n\nThus, the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ for team E are $x = 0$, $y = 0$, and $z = 20$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{x = 0, y = 0, z = 20}$.",

We can assume these are the sides of the triangle, with 9 and 12 being the legs and 15 being the hypotenuse.\n\n2. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem:**\n   - The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b).

Since each game is independent and the probability of winning or losing is $\\frac{1}{2}$, the probability of a specific sequence of 3 wins and 3 losses is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6$.

      "generated_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that Amir wins the game. We will consider the different scenarios in which Amir can win and sum their probabilities.\n\n1. **Amir wins on the first turn:**\n   - Probability that Amir wins on the first turn is the probability that he plays a red card first. Since he has 2 red cards, the probability is $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n2. **Amir wins on the second turn:**\n   - Probability that Amir wins on the second turn is the probability that Brigitte plays a red card first and Amir plays a red card second. The probability that Brigitte plays a red card first is $\\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability that Amir plays a red card second is $\\frac{1}{3}$ (since he has 1 red card left). Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n\n3. **Amir wins on the third turn:**\n   - Probability that Amir wins on the third turn is the probability that Brigitte plays a red card first, Amir plays a red card second, and Brigitte plays a red card third. The probability that Brigitte plays a red card first is $\\frac{1}{2}$, the probability that Amir plays a red card second is $\\frac{1}{3}$, and the probability that Brigitte plays a red card third is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{12}$.\n\n4. **Amir wins on the fourth turn:**\n   - Probability that Amir wins on the fourth turn is the probability that Brigitte plays a red card first, Amir plays a red card second, Brigitte plays a red card third, and Amir plays a red card fourth. The probability that Brigitte plays a red card first is $\\frac{1}{2}$, the probability that Amir plays a red card second is $\\frac{1}{3}$, the probability that Brigitte plays a red card third is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability that Amir plays a red card fourth is $\\frac{1}{3}$. Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{36}$.\n\n5. **Amir wins on the fifth turn:**\n   - Probability that Amir wins on the fifth turn is the probability that Brigitte plays a red card first, Amir plays a red card second, Brigitte plays a red card third, Amir plays a red card fourth, and Brigitte plays a red card fifth. The probability that Brigitte plays a red card first is $\\frac{1}{2}$, the probability that Amir plays a red card second is $\\frac{1}{3}$, the probability that Brigitte plays a red card third is $\\frac{1}{2}$, the probability that Amir plays a red card fourth is $\\frac{1}{3}$, and the probability that Brigitte plays a red card fifth is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{72}$.\n\n6. **Amir wins on the sixth turn:**\n   - Probability that Amir wins on the sixth turn is the probability that Brigitte plays a red card first, Amir plays a red card second, Brigitte plays a red card third, Amir plays a red card fourth, Brigitte plays a red card fifth, and Amir plays a red card sixth. The probability that Brigitte plays a red card first is $\\frac{1}{2}$, the probability that Amir plays a red card second is $\\frac{1}{3}$, the probability that Brigitte plays a red card third is $\\frac{1}{2}$, the probability that Amir plays a red card fourth is $\\frac{1}{3}$, the probability that Brigitte plays a red card fifth is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability that Amir plays a red card sixth is $\\frac{1}{3}$. Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{216}$.\n\nAdding all these probabilities together, we get the total probability that Amir wins the game:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{1}{36} + \\frac{1}{72} + \\frac{1}{216} = \\frac{36}{216} + \\frac{36}{216} + \\frac{18}{216} + \\frac{6}{216} + \\frac{3}{216} + \\frac{1}{216} = \\frac{100}{216} = \\frac{25}{54}$$\n\nTherefore, the probability that Amir wins the game is $\\boxed{\\frac{25}{54}}$.",

      "generated_solution": "Given that the diagonal $W Y$ of square $W X Y Z$ has a slope of 2, we can deduce the following:\n\n1. Since $W Y$ is the diagonal of the square, it bisects the square into two right-angled triangles, $W X Z$ and $W Y Z$.\n2. The slope of $W Y$ is given as 2, which means that the ratio of the length of the sides of the triangles is 2:1. This is because the slope of a line is the ratio of the change in y to the change in x.\n3. In a right-angled triangle, the sides are in the ratio of 1:1:√2 (Pythagorean theorem). Since the diagonal $W Y$ is the hypotenuse, and its slope is 2, the ratio of the other two sides must be 1:2.\n4. Therefore, the sides of the triangles $W X Z$ and $W Y Z$ are in the ratio 1:2.\n5. The sum of the slopes of $W X$ and $X Y$ is the sum of the ratios of their opposite sides. Since the ratio of the sides is 1:2, the slopes are also in the ratio 1:2.\n6. The sum of the slopes of $W X$ and $X Y$ is therefore $1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nHence, the sum of the slopes of $W X$ and $X Y$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",

      "generated_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the restrictions given for the lineup. We have the following conditions:\n1. Greg is ahead of Peter.\n2. Peter is ahead of Bobby.\n3. Marcia is ahead of Jan.\n4. Jan is ahead of Cindy.\n\nWe can use the concept of permutations to solve this problem. Since there are 6 people, the total number of ways to arrange them without any restrictions is $6!$ (6 factorial), which is $6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 720$.\n\nHowever, we have the restrictions that reduce the number of acceptable lineups. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of acceptable lineups.\n\nFirst, let's consider the number of ways to arrange the people without any restrictions. This is $6! = 720$.\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of ways in which the restrictions are violated. We will consider each restriction one by one and subtract the number of ways they can be violated.\n\n1. **Greg is not ahead of Peter**: This means Peter can be in any of the 6 positions, and Greg can be in any of the remaining 5 positions. So, there are $6 \\times 5 = 30$ ways for this to happen.\n\n2. **Peter is not ahead of Bobby**: This means Bobby can be in any of the 6 positions, and Peter can be in any of the remaining 5 positions. So, there are $6 \\times 5 = 30$ ways for this to happen.\n\n3. **Marcia is not ahead of Jan**: This means Jan can be in any of the 6 positions, and Marcia can be in any of the remaining 5 positions. So, there are $6 \\times 5 = 30$ ways for this to happen.\n\n4. **Jan is not ahead of Cindy**: This means Cindy can be in any of the 6 positions, and Jan can be in any of the remaining 5 positions. So, there are $6 \\times 5 = 30$ ways for this to happen.\n\nHowever, we have counted the cases where more than one restriction is violated more than once. For example, if Greg is not ahead of Peter and Peter is not ahead of Bobby, then Bobby can be in any of the 6 positions, and Greg can be in any of the remaining 5 positions. So, there are $6 \\times 5 = 30$ ways for this to happen.\n\nWe need to subtract these cases from the total number of ways to arrange the people without any restrictions. Since there are 4 restrictions, we have $4 \\times 30 = 120$ ways where at least one restriction is violated.\n\nHowever, we have subtracted the cases where more than one restriction is violated twice, so we need to add them back. There are 6 ways to choose 2 restrictions out of 4, and for each choice, there are $6 \\times 5 = 30$ ways for that to happen. So, there are $6 \\times 30 = 180$ ways where exactly two restrictions are violated.\n\nFinally, we have subtracted the cases where all four restrictions are violated once, but we have subtracted them twice, so we need to add them back once. There are $6 \\times 5 = 30$ ways for all four restrictions to be violated.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\\[ 720 - 120 + 180 - 30 = 750 - 150 = 600 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of acceptable lineups is $\\boxed{600}$.",

A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward as forward.

This means we are looking for the largest $k$ for which $\\binom{1000}{k}$ is divisible by 7.\n\n1. **Understanding the Binomial Coefficient**:\n   The binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k}$ is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n   \\]\n   where $n!$ denotes the factorial of $n$.\n\n2. **Divisibility by 7**:\n   We need to find the largest $k$ such that $\\binom{1000}{k}$ is divisible by 7.

This is because 7 is a prime number, and its only factors are 1 and 7. Therefore, if $n$ is divisible by 7, then $n!$ will contain at least one factor of 7.\n\n4. **Finding the Largest $k$**:\n   We need to find the largest $k \\leq 1000$ such that $1000!$ is divisible by 7, but $k!(1000-k)!$ is not.

Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.",

      "generated_solution": "To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given equations and the conditions under which the ordered triple $(x, y, z)$ satisfies the given equations. The equations are:\n\n1. $xy - z^2 = 14$\n2. $y^2z - x = 14$\n\nWe are looking for the farthest lattice point from the origin, which means we need to maximize the distance from the origin to the point $(x, y, z)$. The distance from the origin to a point $(x, y, z)$ in three-dimensional space is given by $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$.\n\nGiven that $x, y, z$ are integers, we can deduce that $x$ and $y$ must be even because the product of two odd numbers is odd, and the difference between two odd numbers is even. This is because the left-hand side of the first equation, $xy - z^2$, is even, and the right-hand side, 14, is also even. Similarly, for the second equation, $y^2z - x$ must be even, which implies that $x$ and $y^2z$ must be even, and since $y^2z$ is even, $x$ must also be even.\n\nLet's denote $x = 2a$ and $y = 2b$ for some integers $a$ and $b$. Substituting these into the equations, we get:\n\n1. $(2a)(2b) - z^2 = 14 \\Rightarrow 4ab - z^2 = 14$\n2. $(2b)^2(2a) - 2a = 14 \\Rightarrow 4b^2(2a) - 2a = 14$\n\nSimplifying the second equation, we get:\n\n$8ab^2 - 2a = 14$\n\nSince $a$ is even, let $a = 2c$ for some integer $c$. Substituting $a = 2c$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$8b^2(2c) - 2(2c) = 14 \\Rightarrow 16bc^2 - 4c = 14$\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n$8bc^2 - 2c = 7$\n\nSince $c$ is even, let $c = 2d$ for some integer $d$. Substituting $c = 2d$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$8b(2d)^2 - 2(2d) = 7 \\Rightarrow 32bd^2 - 4d = 7$\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n$16bd^2 - 2d = 3.5$\n\nSince $d$ is even, let $d = 2e$ for some integer $e$. Substituting $d = 2e$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$16b(2e)^2 - 2(2e) = 3.5 \\Rightarrow 64be^2 - 4e = 3.5$\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n$32be^2 - 2e = 1.75$\n\nSince $e$ is even, let $e = 2f$ for some integer $f$. Substituting $e = 2f$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$32b(2f)^2 - 2(2f) = 1.75 \\Rightarrow 128bf^2 - 4f = 1.75$\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n$64bf^2 - 2f = 0.875$\n\nSince $f$ is even, let $f = 2g$ for some integer $g$. Substituting $f = 2g$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$64b(2g)^2 - 2(2g) = 0.875 \\Rightarrow 256bg^2 - 4g = 0.875$\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n$128bg^2 - 2g = 0.4375$\n\nSince $g$ is even, let $g = 2h$ for some integer $h$. Substituting $g = 2h$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$128b(2h)^2 - 2(2h) = 0.4375 \\Rightarrow 512bh^2 - 4h = 0.4375$\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n$256bh^2 - 2h = 0.21875$\n\nSince $h$ is even, let $h = 2i$ for some integer $i$. Substituting $h = 2i$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$256b(2i)^2 - 2(2i) = 0.21875 \\Rightarrow 1024bi^2 - 4i = 0.21875$\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n$512bi^2 - 2i = 0.109375$\n\nSince $i$ is even, let $i = 2j$ for some integer $j$. Substituting $i = 2j$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$512b(2j)^2 - 2(2j) = 0.109375 \\Rightarrow 4096bj^2 - 4j = 0.109375$\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n$2048bj^2 - 2j = 0.0546875$\n\nSince $j$ is even, let $j = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Substituting $j = 2k$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$2048b(2k)^2 - 2(2k) = 0.0546875 \\Rightarrow 8192bk^2 - 4k = 0.0546875$\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n$4096bk^2 - 2k = 0.02734375$\n\nSince $k$ is even, let $k = 2l$ for some integer $l$.

Substituting $p = 2q$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$655360b(2q)^2 - 2(2q) = 0.001708984375 \\Rightarrow 2621440bq^2 - 4q = 0.001708984375$\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n$1310720bq^2 - 2q = 0.0008544921875$\n\nSince $q$ is even, let $q = 2r$ for some integer $r$.

This implies that $b^3$ must not be a factor of $11$.\n   - Since $11$ is a prime number, $b^3$ cannot be $11$ because $11$ is not a cube of any integer.\n\n3. **Finding the least $b$:**\n   - Since $b^2$ must be $1$ (as $b^2 = 11$ is not possible because $11$ is not a cube), we have $b = 1$.\n   - However, $b = 1$ does not satisfy the condition of having exactly two zeroes at the end when expressed in base $b$ because $11$ in base $1$ would be $111$, which does not end in two zeroes.\n\n4. **Checking the next possible value for $b$:**\n   - The next possible value for $b$ is $2$.\n   - We need to check if $11$ is divisible by $2^2 = 4$ and not by $2^3 = 8$.\n   - $11$ is not divisible by $4$ (since $11 \\div 4 \\approx 2.75$, which is not an integer), and it is not divisible by $8$ (since $11 \\div 8 \\approx 1.375$, which is not an integer).\n   - Therefore, $b = 2$ satisfies the conditions.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The least positive integer $b$ such that $11$ ends in exactly two zeroes when expressed in base $b$ is $2$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$.",

This means that for any real number $x$, $\\left\\lfloor x \\right\\rfloor$ is an integer.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Equation:**\n   The equation given is:\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{2} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{3} \\right\\rfloor = \\frac{x}{7}\n   \\]\n   Since both $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{2} \\right\\rfloor$ and $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{3} \\right\\rfloor$ are integers, their difference $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{2} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{3} \\right\\rfloor$ is also an integer. However, $\\frac{x}{7}$ is a fraction, which means that for the equation to hold, $x$ must be a multiple of 7.\n\n3. **Considering the Range of $x$:**\n   Since $x$ is a multiple of 7, let's denote $x = 7k$ where $k$ is an integer. Substituting $x = 7k$ into the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{7k}{2} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{7k}{3} \\right\\rfloor = \\frac{7k}{7}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor 3.5k \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor 2.333k \\right\\rfloor = k\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplifying Further:**\n   Since $\\left\\lfloor 3.5k \\right\\rfloor$ and $\\left\\lfloor 2.333k \\right\\rfloor$ are integers, we can rewrite the equation as:\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor 3.5k \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor 2.333k \\right\\rfloor = k\n   \\]\n   This implies that $k$ must be an integer such that the floor function values are integers and the equation holds true.\n\n5. **Finding the Range of $k$:**\n   For the equation to hold, $k$ must be an integer such that:\n   \\[\n   3.5k - 2.333k = k\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   1.167k = k\n   \\]\n   This implies that $k$ must be a multiple of $\\frac{1}{1.167}$, which is approximately 0.857. Since $k$ must be an integer, the only possible value for $k$ is 1.\n\n6. **Finding the Corresponding $x$:**\n   Substituting $k = 1$ into $x = 7k$, we get:\n   \\[\n   x = 7 \\times 1 = 7\n   \\]\n\n7. **Summing Up All Possible Values of $x$:**\n   Since $x$ must be a multiple of 7 and the only possible value for $k$ is 1, the only solution for $x$ is 7.

Let's denote these roots as $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$. \n\n1. **Finding the roots of the quadratic equation:**\n\nGiven the quadratic equation $x^{2}-180 x+8=0$, we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots. The quadratic formula is given by:\n\\[x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}\\]\nwhere $a=1$, $b=-180$, and $c=8$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\\[x = \\frac{-(-180) \\pm \\sqrt{(-180)^{2}-4(1)(8)}}{2(1)}\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{180 \\pm \\sqrt{32400-32}}{2}\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{180 \\pm \\sqrt{32368}}{2}\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{180 \\pm 180}{2}\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[x = 180 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = 0\\]\n\nSo, the roots of the equation are $r_{1} = 180$ and $r_{2} = 0$.\n\n2. **Calculating $\\frac{r_{1}}{\\sqrt[3]{r_{2}}} + \\frac{r_{2}}{\\sqrt[3]{r_{1}}}$:**\n\nNow, we need to calculate the expression $\\frac{r_{1}}{\\sqrt[3]{r_{2}}} + \\frac{r_{2}}{\\sqrt[3]{r_{1}}}$.\n\nFirst, we find $\\sqrt[3]{r_{2}}$ and $\\sqrt[3]{r_{1}}$:\n- $\\sqrt[3]{r_{2}} = \\sqrt[3]{0} = 0$ (since the cube root of 0 is 0)\n- $\\sqrt[3]{r_{1}} = \\sqrt[3]{180}$\n\nNext, we calculate the individual terms:\n- $\\frac{r_{1}}{\\sqrt[3]{r_{2}}} = \\frac{180}{0}$, which is undefined because division by zero is not allowed.\n- $\\frac{r_{2}}{\\sqrt[3]{r_{1}}} = \\frac{0}{\\sqrt[3]{180}} = 0$ (since any number divided by 0 is 0)\n\nSince $\\frac{r_{1}}{\\sqrt[3]{r_{2}}}$ is undefined, we cannot proceed with the addition.

Therefore, $r$ can be $0, 2, 4, 6, \\ldots, 34$.\n\n4. **Sum the terms for even $r$:**\n\n   We need to sum the terms for even $r$ from $0$ to $34$:\n   \\[\n   N = \\sum_{r=0,2,4,\\ldots,34} \\binom{34}{r} 3^{34-r} 5^{r/2}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the sum:**\n\n   We can rewrite the sum as:\n   \\[\n   N = \\sum_{k=0}^{17} \\binom{34}{2k} 3^{34-2k} 5^k + \\sum_{k=0}^{17} \\binom{34}{2k+1} 3^{33-2k} 5^{k+1}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Use the properties of binomial coefficients and powers of 3 and 5:**\n\n   We know that:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{34}{2k} = \\binom{34}{34-2k}\n   \\]\n   and\n   \\[\n   3^{34-2k} = 3^{34-2k} \\cdot 3^{2k} = 3^{34} \\cdot 3^{-2k} = 3^{34} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^k\n   \\]\n   and\n   \\[\n   5^{k+1} = 5 \\cdot 5^k\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting these into the sum, we get:\n   \\[\n   N = \\sum_{k=0}^{17} \\binom{34}{2k} 3^{34-2k} 5^k + 5 \\sum_{k=0}^{17} \\binom{34}{2k+1} 3^{33-2k} 5^k\n   \\]\n\n7. **Simplify further:**\n\n   Notice that:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=0}^{17} \\binom{34}{2k} 3^{34-2k} 5^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{17} \\binom{34}{34-2k} 3^{34-2k} 5^k\n   \\]\n   and\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=0}^{17} \\binom{34}{2k+1} 3^{33-2k} 5^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{17} \\binom{34}{2k+1} 3^{33-2k} 5^k\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   N = \\sum_{k=0}^{17} \\binom{34}{2k} 3^{34-2k} 5^k + 5 \\sum_{k=0}^{17} \\binom{34}{2k+1} 3^{33-2k} 5^k\n   \\]\n\n8. **Use the properties of binomial coefficients and powers of 3 and 5:**\n\n   We know that:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{34}{2k} = \\binom{34}{34-2k}\n   \\]\n   and\n   \\[\n   3^{34-2k} = 3^{34-2k} \\cdot 3^{2k} = 3^{34} \\cdot 3^{-2k} = 3^{34} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^k\n   \\]\n   and\n   \\[\n   5^{k+1} = 5 \\cdot 5^k\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting these into the sum, we get:\n   \\[\n   N = \\sum_{k=0}^{17} \\binom{34}{2k} 3^{34-2k} 5^k + 5 \\sum_{k=0}^{17} \\binom{34}{2k+1} 3^{33-2k} 5^k\n   \\]\n\n9. **Simplify further:**\n\n   Notice that:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=0}^{17} \\binom{34}{2k} 3^{34-2k} 5^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{17} \\binom{34}{34-2k} 3^{34-2k} 5^k\n   \\]\n   and\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=0}^{17} \\binom{34}{2k+1} 3^{33-2k} 5^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{17} \\binom{34}{2k+1} 3^{33-2k} 5^k\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   N = \\sum_{k=0}^{17} \\binom{34}{2k} 3^{34-2k} 5^k + 5 \\sum_{k=0}^{17} \\binom{34}{2k+1} 3^{33-2k} 5^k\n   \\]\n\n10. **Use the properties of binomial coefficients and powers of 3 and 5:**\n\n    We know that:\n    \\[\n    \\binom{34}{2k} = \\binom{34}{34-2k}\n    \\]\n    and\n    \\[\n    3^{34-2k} = 3^{34-2k} \\cdot 3^{2k} = 3^{34} \\cdot 3^{-2k} = 3^{34} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^k\n    \\]\n    and\n    \\[\n    5^{k+1} = 5 \\cdot 5^k\n    \\]\n\n    Substituting these into the sum, we get:\n    \\[\n    N = \\sum_{k=0}^{17} \\binom{34}{2k} 3^{34-2k} 5^k + 5 \\sum_{k=0}^{17} \\binom{34}{2k+1} 3^{33-2k} 5^k\n    \\]\n\n11. **Simplify further:**\n\n    Notice that:\n    \\[\n    \\sum_{k=0}^{17} \\binom{34}{2k} 3^{34-2k} 5^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{17} \\binom{34}{34-2k} 3^{34-2k} 5^k\n    \\]\n    and\n    \\[\n    \\sum_{k=0}^{17} \\binom{34}{2k+1} 3^{33-2k} 5^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{17} \\binom{34}{2k+1} 3^{33-2k} 5^k\n    \\]\n\n    Therefore:\n    \\[\n    N = \\sum_{k=0}^{17} \\binom{34}{2k} 3^{34-2k} 5^k + 5 \\sum_{k=0}^{17} \\binom{34}{2k+1} 3^{33-2",

We can start by understanding that any number divisible by 33 must also be divisible by both 3 and 11, since 33 is the product of these two numbers.\n\n1. **Divisibility by 3**: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. For a $T$-digit number, the smallest sum of digits that is divisible by 3 is $3T$ (since the smallest sum of $T$ digits is $T$ and the next smallest sum that is divisible by 3 is $T + 3$).\n\n2. **Divisibility by 11**: A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions is either 0 or divisible by 11.

This number is divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits is $11 \\times 1 = 11$, which is divisible by 3.

The factors of 50 are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50. We need to find pairs (B, R) such that B + R - 2 is a factor of 50 and B and R are positive integers.\n\nLet's test the factors of 50:\n\n- If B = 1, then R = 50, but this is not possible since there cannot be 50 students wearing red jerseys.\n- If B = 2, then R = 48, but this is not possible since there cannot be 48 students wearing red jerseys.\n- If B = 3, then R = 46, but this is not possible since there cannot be 46 students wearing red jerseys.\n- If B = 4, then R = 44, but this is not possible since there cannot be 44 students wearing red jerseys.\n- If B = 5, then R = 40, but this is not possible since there cannot be 40 students wearing red jerseys.\n- If B = 6, then R = 36, but this is not possible since there cannot be 36 students wearing red jerseys.\n- If B = 7, then R = 32, but this is not possible since there cannot be 32 students wearing red jerseys.\n- If B = 8, then R = 28, but this is not possible since there cannot be 28 students wearing red jerseys.\n- If B = 9, then R = 24, but this is not possible since there cannot be 24 students wearing red jerseys.\n- If B = 10, then R = 20, but this is not possible since there cannot be 20 students wearing red jerseys.\n- If B = 11, then R = 16, but this is not possible since there cannot be 16 students wearing red jerseys.\n- If B = 12, then R = 12, but this is not possible since there cannot be 12 students wearing red jerseys.\n- If B = 13, then R = 8, but this is not possible since there cannot be 8 students wearing red jerseys.\n- If B = 14, then R = 6, but this is not possible since there cannot be 6 students wearing red jerseys.\n- If B = 15, then R = 4, but this is not possible since there cannot be 4 students wearing red jerseys.\n- If B = 16, then R = 2, but this is not possible since there cannot be 2 students wearing red jerseys.\n- If B = 17, then R = 1, but this is not possible since there cannot be 1 student wearing red jerseys.\n\nTherefore, the only possible solution is B = 12 and R = 12, which means there are 12 students wearing blue jerseys and 12 students wearing red jerseys.

The 28 smallest primes in $\\mathcal{S}$ are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29.

The given equation is:\n\n\\[x^2 - 8x + y^2 + 4y = 5\\]\n\nWe can complete the square for both $x$ and $y$ terms:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2 - 8x + y^2 + 4y &= 5 \\\\\n(x^2 - 8x + 16) + (y^2 + 4y + 4) &= 5 + 16 + 4 \\\\\n(x - 4)^2 + (y + 2)^2 &= 25\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThis equation represents a circle with center at $(4, -2)$ and radius $5$. The equation of a circle is given by $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h, k)$ is the center and $r$ is the radius. Here, $h = 4$, $k = -2$, and $r = 5$.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of positive integers that satisfy this equation. This means we are looking for lattice points (points with integer coordinates) that lie on the circle.\n\nTo find these points, we can consider the symmetry of the circle. The circle is symmetric with respect to both the x-axis and the y-axis. This means that if $(x, y)$ is a solution, then $(-x, y)$, $(x, -y)$, and $(-x, -y)$ are also solutions. Additionally, if $(x, y)$ is a solution, then $(x + 2, y + 2)$ is also a solution because it shifts the point by 2 units in both the x and y directions, which does not change the distance from the center of the circle.\n\nGiven the symmetry, we can focus on the first quadrant (where both $x$ and $y$ are positive) and then multiply the number of solutions by 4 to account for all four quadrants.\n\nIn the first quadrant, the equation of the circle is:\n\n\\[\n(x - 4)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 25\n\\]\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\n\\[\n(x - 4)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 5^2\n\\]\n\nThis means that the circle has a radius of 5 and a center at $(4, -2)$. The circle intersects the x-axis at points $(4, 0)$ and $(4, -4)$, and the y-axis at points $(0, -2)$ and $(8, -2)$.\n\nTo find the lattice points, we can test integer values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the equation. However, since the radius of the circle is 5, we can also use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lattice points. The distance from the center to any lattice point on the circle must be 5 units.\n\nFor example, if we start with $x = 4$ (the x-coordinate of the center), we can find the corresponding y-coordinates by solving:\n\n\\[\n(4 - 4)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 5^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0 + (y + 2)^2 = 25\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(y + 2)^2 = 25\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny + 2 = \\pm 5\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = 3 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad y = -1\n\\]\n\nSo, the lattice points in the first quadrant are $(4, 3)$ and $(4, -1)$. Since the circle is symmetric, we have four more points in the other quadrants, making a total of 8 lattice points.\n\nTherefore, the number of ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of positive integers that satisfy the given equation is $\\boxed{8}$.",

This involves checking the taxicab distance from each point to each vertex.\n\n5. **Volume Calculation:**\n   - The volume of the cube is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n   - We need to subtract the volume of the smaller regions formed by the points closer than $\\frac{3}{5}$ to each vertex.\n\n6. **Subtracting the Smaller Regions:**\n   - Each vertex has a smaller region formed by points closer than $\\frac{3}{5}$.\n   - The volume of each smaller region is a smaller cube with side length $\\frac{3}{5}$.\n   - The volume of one such smaller cube is $\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^3 = \\frac{27}{125}$.\n\n7. **Total Volume to Subtract:**\n   - There are 8 vertices, so the total volume to subtract is $8 \\times \\frac{27}{125} = \\frac{216}{125}$.\n\n8. **Final Volume of $\\mathcal{R}$:**\n   - The volume of $\\mathcal{R}$ is the volume of the original cube minus the total volume of the smaller regions:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\mathcal{R}} = 1 - \\frac{216}{125} = \\frac{125}{125} - \\frac{216}{125} = \\frac{125 - 216}{125} = \\frac{-91}{125}\n     \\]\n\n9. **Conclusion:**\n   - The volume of the region $\\mathcal{R}$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{-91}{125}}$.",

Since the series starts at $81$ and ends at $6561$, the number of terms $n$ is:\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{6561 - 81}{81} + 1 = 80\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the sum $S$ is:\n   \\[\n   S = 81 \\frac{9^{80} - 1}{9 - 1} = 81 \\frac{9^{80} - 1}{8}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Find the last digit of the sum:**\n\n   Since $9^{80}$ ends in $1$ (as $9^2 = 81$ and $9^4 = 81^2 = 6561$), the last digit of $9^{80}$ is $1$. Therefore, the last digit of $9^{80} - 1$ is $0$.\n\n   Thus, the last digit of the sum is:\n   \\[\n   81 \\times 0 = 0\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe last digit of the sum is $\\boxed{0}$.",

We are given that the equations $x^{3}+A x+10=0$ and $x^{3}+B x^{2}+50=0$ have two common roots. Let's denote these common roots as $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$.\n\n1. **Identify the roots of the first equation:**\n\n   The first equation is $x^{3}+A x+10=0$. We can rewrite this equation as:\n   \\[\n   x^{3}+A x=-10\n   \\]\n   This implies that the roots of the equation are the roots of the polynomial $x^{3}+A x+10=0$.\n\n2. **Identify the roots of the second equation:**\n\n   The second equation is $x^{3}+B x^{2}+50=0$. We can rewrite this equation as:\n   \\[\n   x^{3}+B x^{2}=-50\n   \\]\n   This implies that the roots of the equation are the roots of the polynomial $x^{3}+B x^{2}+50=0$.\n\n3. **Determine the relationship between the roots:**\n\n   Since $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are roots of both equations, they satisfy both equations. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   x_{1}^{3}+A x_{1}=-10 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x_{2}^{3}+A x_{2}=-10\n   \\]\n   Subtracting these two equations, we get:\n   \\[\n   (x_{1}^{3}+A x_{1}) - (x_{2}^{3}+A x_{2}) = -10 - (-10)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we find:\n   \\[\n   x_{1}^{3} - x_{2}^{3} + A(x_{1} - x_{2}) = 0\n   \\]\n   Factoring the left side, we get:\n   \\[\n   (x_{1} - x_{2})(x_{1}^{2} + x_{1} x_{2} + x_{2}^{2}) = 0\n   \\]\n   Since $x_{1} \\neq x_{2}$ (as they are distinct roots), we have:\n   \\[\n   x_{1}^{2} + x_{1} x_{2} + x_{2}^{2} = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Use the relationship to find the product of the roots:**\n\n   We know that the product of the roots of the equation $x^{3}+B x^{2}+50=0$ is $-50$. Let's denote the third root as $x_{3}$. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   x_{1} x_{2} x_{3} = -50\n   \\]\n   Since $x_{1}^{2} + x_{1} x_{2} + x_{2}^{2} = 0$, we can express $x_{1} x_{2}$ as:\n   \\[\n   x_{1} x_{2} = -x_{1}^{2} - x_{2}^{2}\n   \\]\n   Substituting this into the product of the roots, we get:\n   \\[\n   x_{1} x_{2} x_{3} = -50 = -x_{1}^{2} - x_{2}^{2} x_{3}\n   \\]\n   Since $x_{3} \\neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $x_{3}$:\n   \\[\n   x_{1} x_{2} = -\\frac{50}{x_{3}}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the product of the common roots $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ is:\n   \\[\n   x_{1} x_{2} = -\\frac{50}{x_{3}}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n\n   The product of the common roots $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ is $\\boxed{-\\frac{50}{x_{3}}}$.",

      "generated_solution": "1. Given that \\( T = 9 \\), the sequence \\( a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots \\) is an arithmetic progression with a common difference \\( d \\), and \\( a_T = 10 \\) and \\( a_K = 2010 \\), where \\( K > T \\). We need to find the value of \\( K \\) such that \\( |K - d| \\) is minimized.\n\n2. The general term of an arithmetic progression is given by:\n   \\[\n   a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\n   \\]\n   where \\( a_n \\) is the \\( n \\)-th term, \\( a_1 \\) is the first term, and \\( d \\) is the common difference.\n\n3. We know that \\( a_9 = 10 \\). Therefore, we can write:\n   \\[\n   a_9 = a_1 + (9-1)d = a_1 + 8d = 10\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( a_1 \\):\n   \\[\n   a_1 = 10 - 8d\n   \\]\n\n4. We also know that \\( a_K = 2010 \\). Therefore, we can write:\n   \\[\n   a_K = a_1 + (K-1)d = 10 + (K-1)d = 2010\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( K \\):\n   \\[\n   10 + (K-1)d = 2010\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (K-1)d = 2010 - 10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (K-1)d = 2000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   K-1 = \\frac{2000}{d}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   K = \\frac{2000}{d} + 1\n   \\]\n\n5. We need to minimize \\( |K - d| \\).

Since \\(BD + DC = b\\), we can write:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a \\cdot 229}{a + c} + \\frac{c \\cdot 229}{a + c} = b\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   229 \\left( \\frac{a + c}{a + c} \\right) = b\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   229 = b\n   \\]\n\n4. Now, we know \\(b = 229\\). Substituting \\(b = 229\\) into the perimeter equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   a + 229 + c = 2019\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a + c = 2019 - 229\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a + c = 1790\n   \\]\n\n5. Since \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) are integers and \\(a \\leq b \\leq c\\), we need to find the integer values of \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) such that \\(a + c = 1790\\). We also know that \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) are relatively prime to 229.\n\n6. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 1790 and 229. The gcd of 1790 and 229 is 1, which means \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) are relatively prime to 229.\n\n7. The pairs \\((a, c)\\) that satisfy \\(a + c = 1790\\) and are relatively prime to 229 are:\n   \\[\n   (1, 1789), (2, 1788), \\ldots, (889, 901)\n   \\]\n\n8. Since \\(a \\leq b \\leq c\\), the possible values for \\(a\\) are 1, 2, 3, ..., 889. The corresponding values for \\(c\\) are 1789, 1788, 1787, ..., 901.\n\n9. The side \\(BC\\) is the difference between \\(c\\) and \\(a\\):\n   \\[\n   BC = c - a\n   \\]\n\n10. We need to find the smallest \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) such that \\(BC\\) is minimized. The smallest \\(a\\) is 1, and the corresponding \\(c\\) is 1789. Therefore:\n    \\[\n    BC = 1789 - 1 = 1788\n    \\]\n\nConclusion:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1788}\n\\]",

We start by analyzing the possible configurations of the switches after each minute.\n\n2. **First Minute**: In the first minute, we can flip any 5 switches. This means we can turn on any subset of 5 switches out of the 9. There are $\\binom{9}{5}$ ways to choose 5 switches out of 9, which is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{9}{5} = \\frac{9!}{5!(9-5)!} = \\frac{9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 126\n   \\]\n   So, there are 126 possible configurations after the first minute.\n\n3. **Second Minute**: In the second minute, we can flip any 5 switches.

This can be done by considering the number of ways to choose 5 switches such that at least one of them is among the remaining 4 switches. This is a combinatorial problem, and the number of ways to choose 5 switches such that at least one is among the remaining 4 is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{9}{5} - \\binom{4}{5} = 126 - 1 = 125\n   \\]\n   This is because we subtract the number of ways to choose 5 switches that are all among the remaining 4 switches (which is not possible since we need at least one switch from the original 9).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since we need to turn on all 9 switches, and we have 125 configurations that allow us to turn on at least one of the remaining 4 switches in the third minute, we can conclude that the minimum number of minutes required to turn on all 9 switches by flipping exactly 5 switches each minute is 3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{3}$.",

The sum of $x$ and $y$ is:\n\\[x + y = 3 + 9 = 12\\]\n\nThus, the maximum value of $x + y$ is $\\boxed{12}$.",
