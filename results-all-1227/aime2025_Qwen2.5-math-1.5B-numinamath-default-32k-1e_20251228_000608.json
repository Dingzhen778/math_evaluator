Let's break down the solution step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have 12 letters: $A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L$.\n   - These letters are randomly grouped into six pairs.\n   - Each pair of letters is placed next to each other in alphabetical order to form six two-letter words.\n   - These six words are listed alphabetically.\n\n2. **Identifying the Last Word:**\n   - The last word listed will be the one that contains the last letter in the alphabet among the letters used in the last word.\n   - Since we are dealing with two-letter words, the last word will be the one that contains the last letter in the alphabet among the letters used in the last word.\n\n3. **Counting the Favorable Outcomes:**\n   - We need to count the number of ways to form the last word such that it contains the letter $G$.\n   - Since the last word must contain $G$, we need to consider the possible positions of $G$ in the last word.\n\n4. **Calculating the Probability:**\n   - The probability that the last word listed contains $G$ is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.\n   - The total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to form the last word, which is $12$ (since there are 12 letters and each letter can be the last letter in the alphabet among the letters used in the last word).\n   - The number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to form the last word such that it contains $G$. This can be calculated by considering the possible positions of $G$ in the last word and the number of ways to form the remaining words.\n\n5. **Simplifying the Probability:**\n   - After calculating the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes, we can simplify the probability to its lowest terms.\n   - The probability that the last word listed contains $G$ is $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.\n\n6. **Finding $m+n$:**\n   - Once we have the simplified probability $\\frac{m}{n}}$, we can find $m+n$ by simply adding the numerator and the denominator.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{m+n}$.",

The symmetry group of a regular 24-gon is the dihedral group \\( D_{24} \\), which consists of 24 rotations and 24 reflections.\n\n3. **Counting the Configurations:**\n   To count the number of ways to draw the 12 segments, we need to consider the action of the symmetry group on the set of all possible configurations.

According to Burnside's Lemma, the number of distinct configurations is given by the average number of configurations fixed by each group element.\n\n5. **Calculating the Fixed Configurations:**\n   For each group element (rotation or reflection), we need to determine how many configurations are fixed by that element. This involves checking the effect of each group element on the set of vertices and ensuring that the resulting configuration is valid.\n\n6. **Summing the Fixed Configurations:**\n   After calculating the number of fixed configurations for each group element, we sum these values and divide by the order of the group (which is 48 for \\( D_{24} \\)).\n\n7. **Final Calculation:**\n   The final calculation involves summing the fixed configurations and dividing by the order of the group.
