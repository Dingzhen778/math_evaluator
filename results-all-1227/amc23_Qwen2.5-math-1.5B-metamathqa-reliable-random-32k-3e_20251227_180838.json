      "question": "Cities $A$ and $B$ are $45$ miles apart. Alicia lives in $A$ and Beth lives in $B$. Alicia bikes towards $B$ at 18 miles per hour. Leaving at the same time, Beth bikes toward $A$ at 12 miles per hour. How many miles from City $A$ will they be when they meet?",
      "reference_answer": "27",
      "predicted_answer": "27",
      "generated_solution": "1. Alicia and Beth are biking towards each other, so their combined speed is 18 + 12 = 30 miles per hour.\n  2. The distance between City $A$ and City $B$ is 45 miles.\n  3. To find the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.\n  4. Plugging in the values, we get: time = 45 / 30 = 1.5 hours.\n  5. To find the distance from City $A$ where they will meet, we can use the formula: distance = speed * time.\n  6. Plugging in the values, we get: distance = 18 * 1.5 = 27 miles.\n  7. Therefore, Alicia and Beth will meet 27 miles from City $A$.\n  8.

Substituting these expressions into the given equation, we have $(a + bi)^5 = a - bi$.\n  4. Expanding the left side using the binomial theorem, we get $a^5 + 5a^4bi + 10a^3b^2i^2 + 10a^2b^3i^3 + 5ab^4i^4 + b^5i^5 = a - bi$.\n  5. Simplifying the powers of $i$, we have $a^5 + 5a^4bi - 10a^3b^2 - 10a^2b^3i + 5ab^4 - b^5i = a - bi$.\n  6. Equating the real and imaginary parts, we get the following system of equations:\n    * $a^5 - 10a^3b^2 + 5ab^4 = a$\n    * $5a^4b - 10a^2b^3 - b^5 = -b$\n  7. Simplifying the second equation, we have $5a^4b - 10a^2b^3 - b^5 + b = 0$.\n  8. Factoring out $b$, we get $b(5a^4 - 10a^2b^2 - b^4 + 1) = 0$.\n  9. Since $b$ cannot be zero (otherwise $z$ would be real), we have $5a^4 - 10a^2b^2 - b^4 + 1 = 0$.\n  10. Rearranging the terms, we get $5a^4 - 10a^2b^2 - b^4 = -1$.\n  11. Completing the square for the left side, we have $(a^2 - b^2)^2 = -1$.\n  12. Since the square of a real number cannot be negative, there are no real solutions for $a$ and $b$.\n  13.

      "generated_solution": "1. We start by considering the given equation $|1+z+z^{2}|=4$.\n  2. We can rewrite the equation as $|z^2+z+1|=4$.\n  3. Let $z=x+yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.\n  4. Substituting $z=x+yi$ into the equation, we get $|(x+yi)^2+(x+yi)+1|=4$.\n  5. Expanding and simplifying, we have $|x^2-y^2+2xyi+x+yi+1|=4$.\n  6. Combining like terms, we get $|x^2-y^2+x+1+(2xy+y)i|=4$.\n  7. Since the magnitude of a complex number is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of its real and imaginary parts, we have $\\sqrt{(x^2-y^2+x+1)^2+(2xy+y)^2}}=4$.\n  8. Squaring both sides of the equation, we get $(x^2-y^2+x+1)^2+(2xy+y)^2=16$.\n  9. Expanding and simplifying, we have $x^4-2x^2y^2+y^4+2x^3+2x^2-2xy^2-2y^2+2x+2y+1+4x^2y^2+4xy^2+4x^2y+4xy+4x+4y+1=16$.\n  10. Combining like terms, we get $x^4+2x^3+3x^2+2x+1+y^4-2y^2+1=16$.\n  11. Simplifying further, we have $x^4+2x^3+3x^2+2x+1+y^4-2y^2=15$.\n  12. We can rewrite the equation as $(x^2+x+1)^2+(y^2-1)^2=15$.\n  13. Since the sum of two squares is equal to 15, we can conclude that one of the squares must be 0 and the other must be 15.\n  14. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:\n    * Case 1: $(x^2+x+1)^2=0$ and $(y^2-1)^2=15$.\n    * Case 2: $(x^2+x+1)^2=15$ and $(y^2-1)^2=0$.\n  15. In Case 1, we have $x^2+x+1=0$ and $y^2-1=\\pm\\sqrt{15}}$.\n  16. Solving the quadratic equation $x^2+x+1=0$, we find that it has no real solutions.\n  17. Therefore, Case 1 does not provide any valid solutions.\n  18. In Case 2, we have $x^2+x+1=\\pm\\sqrt{15}}$ and $y^2-1=0$.\n  19. Solving the quadratic equation $y^2-1=0$, we find that $y=\\pm1$.\n  20. Substituting $y=\\pm1$ into the equation $x^2+x+1=\\pm\\sqrt{15}}$, we find that $x=\\frac{-1\\pm\\sqrt{15}}{2}$.\n  21. Therefore, the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}}}$.\n  22. The sum of $m$ and $n$ is $15+2=\\boxed{17}$.\n  23.

      "question": "When $n$ standard six-sided dice are rolled, the product of the numbers rolled can be any of $936$ possible values. What is $n$?",
      "reference_answer": "11",
      "predicted_answer": "3",
      "generated_solution": "1. We know that the product of the numbers rolled can be any of 936 possible values.\n  2. Let's consider the prime factorization of 936: $936 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 13$.\n  3. Each die has six faces, so the prime factorization of the product of the numbers rolled can be any combination of the prime factors of the numbers on the dice.\n  4. Since each die has six faces, the prime factorization of the product of the numbers rolled can be any combination of the prime factors of the numbers on the dice.\n  5. To find the number of possible values for the product of the numbers rolled, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the prime factors among the dice.\n  6. For each prime factor, we need to find the number of ways to distribute it among the dice.\n  7. For the prime factor 2, we have three 2's in the prime factorization of 936. We can distribute these 2's among the dice in $\\binom{3+6-1}{6-1}} = \\binom{8}{5} = 56$ ways.\n  8. For the prime factor 3, we have two 3's in the prime factorization of 936. We can distribute these 3's among the dice in $\\binom{2+6-1}{6-1}} = \\binom{7}{5} = 21$ ways.\n  9. For the prime factor 13, we have one 13 in the prime factorization of 936. We can distribute this 13 among the dice in $\\binom{1+6-1}{6-1}} = \\binom{6}{5} = 6$ ways.\n  10. To find the total number of possible values for the product of the numbers rolled, we need to multiply the number of ways to distribute each prime factor among the dice.\n  11. Therefore, the total number of possible values for the product of the numbers rolled is $56 \\cdot 21 \\cdot 6 = 7056$.\n  12. Since the product of the numbers rolled can be any of 936 possible values, we have $n = \\boxed{3}$.\n  13.

      "generated_solution": "1. Convert the width of the strip from millimeters to centimeters: $6.5$ mm = $0.65$ cm.\n  2. Convert the length of the strip from meters to centimeters: $25$ m = $2500$ cm.\n  3. Calculate the area of the strip in square centimeters: $0.65$ cm $\\times$ $2500$ cm = $1625$ square centimeters.\n  4. Since the answer must be an integer from 0 to 999, we round $1625$ to the nearest integer, which is $1625$.\n  5.

      "generated_solution": "The given polynomial is a product of terms of the form $(x-a)^n$, where $a$ is an integer from 1 to 10, and $n$ is the exponent of the term. The roots of the polynomial are the values of $x$ that make each term equal to zero. In this case, the roots are the integers from 1 to 10.\n\nWhen we remove the roots from the number line, we are left with the union of 11 disjoint open intervals. These intervals are the intervals between consecutive roots, and they are open because they do not include the roots themselves.\n\nTo determine on how many of these intervals $P(x)$ is positive, we need to consider the sign of each term in the polynomial. Since each term is of the form $(x-a)^n$, the sign of the term depends on the sign of $(x-a)^n$.\n\nFor each term, we can determine the sign by considering the sign of $(x-a)$ and the parity of $n$. If $(x-a)$ is positive, then $(x-a)^n$ is positive if $n$ is even, and negative if $n$ is odd. If $(x-a)$ is negative, then $(x-a)^n$ is positive if $n$ is odd, and negative if $n$ is even.\n\nSince the polynomial is a product of terms, the sign of the polynomial depends on the signs of the individual terms. If an odd number of terms have a negative sign, then the polynomial is negative. If an even number of terms have a negative sign, then the polynomial is positive.\n\nIn this case, we have 10 terms with a negative sign (the terms with $n$ odd), and 1 term with a positive sign (the term with $n$ even). Therefore, the polynomial is negative on 10 intervals and positive on 1 interval.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{1}$.The answer is: 1\nThe answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The answer is: 1The",
