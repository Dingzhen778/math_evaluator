      "generated_solution": "17_{b} = 1 \\cdot b + 7 = b + 7\n  97_{b} = 9 \\cdot b + 7 = 9b + 7\n  We want to find the sum of all integer bases $b>9$ for which $17_{b}$ is a divisor of $97_{b}$.\n  This means that $97_{b}$ is divisible by $17_{b}$, or in other words, $97_{b} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{17_{b}}$.\n  Substituting the expressions for $17_{b}$ and $97_{b}$, we have $9b + 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{b + 7}$.\n  Simplifying, we get $9b + 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{b + 7}$.\n  This means that $9b + 7$ is divisible by $b + 7$, or in other words, $9b + 7 = k(b + 7)$ for some integer $k$.\n  Expanding and rearranging, we get $9b + 7 = kb + 7k$.\n  Subtracting $7$ from both sides, we get $9b = kb + 7k - 7$.\n  Rearranging, we get $9b - kb = 7k - 7$.\n  Factoring out $b$ on the left side, we get $b(9 - k) = 7(k - 1)$.\n  Since $b > 9$, we must have $9 - k > 0$, or in other words, $k < 9$.\n  Since $b$ is an integer, we must have $7(k - 1)$ divisible by $9 - k$.\n  The only possible values for $k$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8$.\n  Checking each value of $k$, we find that the only values that satisfy the condition are $k = 1$ and $k = 8$.\n  For $k = 1$, we have $b(9 - 1) = 7(1 - 1)$, or in other words, $8b = 0$.\n  Since $b > 9$, this equation has no solutions.\n  For $k = 8$, we have $b(9 - 8) = 7(8 - 1)$, or in other words, $b = 7 \\cdot 7 = 49$.\n  Therefore, the only integer base $b > 9$ for which $17_{b}$ is a divisor of $97_{b}$ is $b = 49$.\n  The sum of all such bases is $49$.\n  Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{49}$.\n  The answer is: 49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49  49",

      "generated_solution": "1. We need to find the number of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 22.\n  2. A number is divisible by 22 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 11.\n  3. A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even.\n  4. A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions is divisible by 11.\n  5. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 22.\n  6. Let $A$ be the set of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 2, and let $B$ be the set of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 11.\n  7. We want to find $|A \\cap B|$.\n  8. By the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have $|A \\cap B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cup B|$.\n  9. We can count the number of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 2 and the number of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 11 separately.\n  10. The number of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 2 is $\\frac{8!}{2} = 20160$.\n  11. The number of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 11 is $\\frac{8!}{11} = 27648$.\n  12. To find $|A \\cup B|$, we need to count the number of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by either 2 or 11.\n  13. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion again to count the number of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by either 2 or 11.\n  14. Let $C$ be the set of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 2 or 11.\n  15. We want to find $|C|$.\n  16. By the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have $|C| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B|$.\n  17. We can substitute the values we found earlier into this equation to find $|C|$.\n  18. $|C| = 20160 + 27648 - 20160 = 27648$.\n  19. Finally, we can find $|A \\cap B|$ by subtracting $|C|$ from the sum of $|A|$ and $|B|$.\n  20. $|A \\cap B| = |A| + |B| - |C| = 20160 + 27648 - 27648 = 20160$.\n  21.

      "question": "An isosceles trapezoid has an inscribed circle tangent to each of its four sides. The radius of the circle is 3, and the area of the trapezoid is 72. Let the parallel sides of the trapezoid have lengths $r$ and $s$, with $r \\neq s$. Find $r^{2}+s^{2}$.",

      "predicted_answer": "378",
      "generated_solution": "1. Let $r$ and $s$ be the lengths of the parallel sides of the trapezoid, with $r > s$.\n  2. Since the trapezoid has an inscribed circle, the sum of the lengths of the parallel sides is equal to the sum of the lengths of the non-parallel sides. Therefore, $r + s = 2(3 + 3) = 24$.\n  3. The area of the trapezoid is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}(r + s)h$, where $h$ is the height of the trapezoid.\n  4. Substituting the given values, we have $72 = \\frac{1}{2}(24)h$. Solving for $h$, we find $h = 6$.\n  5. Now, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the lengths of the non-parallel sides. Let $x$ be the length of one of the non-parallel sides. Then, we have $x^2 = 3^2 + 6^2 = 9 + 36 = 45$.\n  6. Therefore, $x = \\sqrt{45} = 3\\sqrt{5}$.\n  7. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the lengths of the non-parallel sides are equal. Therefore, $r - s = 2(3\\sqrt{5}) = 6\\sqrt{5}$.\n  8. Now, we can solve for $r$ and $s$. Adding the equations $r + s = 24$ and $r - s = 6\\sqrt{5}$, we get $2r = 24 + 6\\sqrt{5}$.\n  9. Solving for $r$, we find $r = 12 + 3\\sqrt{5}$.\n  10. Subtracting the equations $r + s = 24$ and $r - s = 6\\sqrt{5}$, we get $2s = 24 - 6\\sqrt{5}$.\n  11. Solving for $s$, we find $s = 12 - 3\\sqrt{5}$.\n  12. Finally, we can find $r^2 + s^2$:\n  \\begin{align*}\n  r^2 + s^2 &= (12 + 3\\sqrt{5})^2 + (12 - 3\\sqrt{5})^2 \\\\\n  &= (144 + 72\\sqrt{5} + 45) + (144 - 72\\sqrt{5} + 45) \\\\\n  &= 2(144 + 45) \\\\\n  &= 2(189) \\\\\n  &= \\boxed{378}.\n  \\end{align*}\n  13.

Let's assume that the circumference of the disk is 1 unit.\n  7. The length of each existing line segment is equal to the length of the arc it subtends on the perimeter of the disk.\n  8. Since the line segments are drawn in different quadrants, the length of each existing line segment is equal to 1/4 of the circumference of the disk.\n  9. Therefore, the probability of intersecting with a given existing line segment is equal to (1/4) / 1 = 1/4.\n  10. Since there are 27 line segments drawn through the disk, the expected number of regions created by these line segments is equal to 1 + (27 - 1) * (1/4)) = 1 + 26 * (1/4)) = 1 + 6.5 = 7.5.\n  11. Since the answer must be an integer from 0 to 999, we round 7.5 to the nearest integer, which is 8.\n  12. Therefore, the expected number of regions into which these 27 line segments divide the disk is \\boxed{8}.\n  13. The answer is: 8  14. The answer is: 8  15. The answer is: 8  16.

      "generated_solution": "1. We start by finding the lengths of the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$.\n  2. Using the Law of Cosines, we find that $AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2(AB)(BC))\\cos(60^\\circ)$ and $BD^2 = BC^2 + CD^2 - 2(BC)(CD))\\cos(60^\\circ)$.\n  3.

Using the Law of Cosines again, we find that $f(X)$ is minimized when $X$ is the intersection of the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$.\n  5. Using the coordinates of the vertices of the pentagon, we find that the coordinates of the intersection of the diagonals are $(\\frac{14+24}{2}, \\frac{7+24}{2}))$.\n  6. Substituting these coordinates into the expression for $f(X)$, we find that the least possible value of $f(X)$ is $m+n\\sqrt{p}$, where $m=140$, $n=10$, and $p=7$.\n  7.

      "generated_solution": "1. We start by finding the pattern of powers of 3 modulo 7. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9 ≡ 2 (mod 7), 3^3 = 27 ≡ 6 (mod 7), 3^4 = 81 ≡ 4 (mod 7), 3^5 = 243 ≡ 5 (mod 7), 3^6 = 729 ≡ 1 (mod 7). So the cycle length is 6.\n  2. Since $a^3+b^3+c^3$ is a multiple of $3^7$, we can write $a^3+b^3+c^3 = 3^7k$ for some integer $k$.\n  3. We can rewrite the equation as $a^3+b^3+c^3 = 3^6 \\cdot 3k$.\n  4. Since $a^3+b^3+c^3$ is a multiple of $3^6$, we can write $a^3+b^3+c^3 = 3^6m$ for some integer $m$.\n  5. Therefore, we have $3^6m = 3^6 \\cdot 3k$, which implies $m = 3k$.\n  6. Since $a,b,c\\leq3^6$, we can write $a = 3^6a'$, $b = 3^6b'$, and $c = 3^6c'$ for some integers $a',b',c'$.\n  7. Substituting these values into the equation $a^3+b^3+c^3 = 3^6m$, we get $(3^6a')^3 + (3^6b')^3 + (3^6c')^3 = 3^6m$.\n  8. Simplifying, we get $3^{18}a'^3 + 3^{18}b'^3 + 3^{18}c'^3 = 3^6m$.\n  9. Dividing both sides by $3^6$, we get $3^{12}a'^3 + 3^{12}b'^3 + 3^{12}c'^3 = m$.\n  10. Since $m = 3k$, we can write $3^{12}a'^3 + 3^{12}b'^3 + 3^{12}c'^3 = 3k$.\n  11. Dividing both sides by 3, we get $3^{11}a'^3 + 3^{11}b'^3 + 3^{11}c'^3 = k$.\n  12. Since $a',b',c'$ are positive integers, we can write $a' = 3^6a''$, $b' = 3^6b''$, and $c' = 3^6c''$ for some positive integers $a'',b'',c''$.\n  13. Substituting these values into the equation $3^{11}a'^3 + 3^{11}b'^3 + 3^{11}c'^3 = k$, we get $3^{11}(3^6a'')^3 + 3^{11}(3^6b'')^3 + 3^{11}(3^6c'')^3 = k$.\n  14. Simplifying, we get $3^{27}a''^3 + 3^{27}b''^3 + 3^{27}c''^3 = k$.\n  15.

Substituting these values into the equation $3^{27}a''^3 + 3^{27}b''^3 + 3^{27}c''^3 = k$, we get $3^{27}(3^6a''')^3 + 3^{27}(3^6b''')^3 + 3^{27}(3^6c''')^3 = k$.\n  17. Simplifying, we get $3^{45}a'''^3 + 3^{45}b'''^3 + 3^{45}c'''^3 = k$.\n  18.

Substituting these values into the equation $3^{45}a'''^3 + 3^{45}b'''^3 + 3^{45}c'''^3 = k$, we get $3^{45}(3^6a''')^3 + 3^{45}(3^6b''')^3 + 3^{45}(3^6c''')^3 = k$.\n  20.

      "generated_solution": "1. First, we find the prime factorization of 2025: $2025 = 3^4 \\cdot 5^2$.\n  2. Next, we determine the set $A$ of positive integer divisors of 2025. The divisors of 2025 are all the possible products of the prime factors $3^4$ and $5^2$. Therefore, $A$ consists of all divisors of the form $3^a \\cdot 5^b$, where $0 \\leq a \\leq 4$ and $0 \\leq b \\leq 2$.\n  3. To find the probability that a randomly selected subset $B$ of $A$ has the property that the least common multiple of its elements is 2025, we need to count the number of subsets $B$ that satisfy this condition.\n  4. We can count the number of subsets $B$ by considering the prime factorization of 2025. For each prime factor $p$ of 2025, we need to count the number of subsets $B$ that include at least one divisor of the form $p^a$ for some $a$.\n  5. For the prime factor 3, we have 5 choices for the exponent $a$ (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4). Therefore, there are $2^5 = 32$ subsets $B$ that include at least one divisor of the form $3^a$.\n  6. Similarly, for the prime factor 5, we have 3 choices for the exponent $b$ (0, 1, or 2). Therefore, there are $2^3 = 8$ subsets $B$ that include at least one divisor of the form $5^b$.\n  7. To find the total number of subsets $B$ that satisfy the given condition, we multiply the number of choices for each prime factor: $32 \\cdot 8 = 256$.\n  8. The total number of subsets of $A$ is $2^{|A|}}$, where $|A|$ is the number of elements in $A$. Since $A$ consists of all divisors of the form $3^a \\cdot 5^b$, where $0 \\leq a \\leq 4$ and $0 \\leq b \\leq 2$, we have $|A| = 5 \\cdot 3 = 15$. Therefore, the total number of subsets of $A$ is $2^{15} = 32768$.\n  9. The probability that a randomly selected subset $B$ of $A$ has the property that the least common multiple of its elements is 2025 is the ratio of the number of subsets $B$ that satisfy the given condition to the total number of subsets of $A$: $\\frac{256}{32768} = \\frac{1}{128}$.\n  10. Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{1}{128}$, and the answer is $1 + 128 = \\boxed{129}$.\n  11.

      "question": "From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $ N $ cents, where $ N $ is a positive integer. He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.",

      "generated_solution": "1. We can start by considering the number of ways to draw 12 segments of equal lengths from the 24 vertices of the regular 24-gon.\n  2. Since each vertex must be an endpoint of exactly one of the 12 segments, we can think of this as a permutation problem.\n  3. The number of ways to arrange 12 segments among 24 vertices is given by the formula $\\frac{24!}{(24-12)! \\cdot 12!}}$.\n  4. Simplifying this expression, we get $\\frac{24!}{12! \\cdot 12!}}$.\n  5. Using a calculator or computer, we can find that this expression evaluates to 2,704,156.\n  6. Therefore, the number of ways to draw 12 segments of equal lengths so that each vertex in $ S $ is an endpoint of exactly one of the 12 segments is $\\boxed{2704156}$.\n  7.
