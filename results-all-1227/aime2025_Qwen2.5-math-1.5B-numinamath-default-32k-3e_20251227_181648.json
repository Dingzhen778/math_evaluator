This means that no two selected chairs can be adjacent.\n\nWe can use a combinatorial approach to solve this problem. We will use the concept of \"gaps\" to ensure that no two selected chairs are adjacent.\n\n1. **Define the problem in terms of gaps:**\n   - We have 16 chairs in a row.\n   - We need to select 8 chairs such that no two selected chairs are adjacent.\n   - To ensure no two selected chairs are adjacent, we can think of placing 8 selected chairs and 7 gaps (one gap between each pair of selected chairs) in the remaining 8 chairs.\n\n2. **Count the number of ways to place the selected chairs and gaps:**\n   - We have 16 chairs in total.\n   - We need to select 8 chairs such that no two selected chairs are adjacent.\n   - To ensure no two selected chairs are adjacent, we can think of placing 8 selected chairs and 7 gaps (one gap between each pair of selected chairs) in the remaining 8 chairs.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of valid subsets:**\n   - We need to count the number of ways to select 8 chairs out of 16 such that no two selected chairs are adjacent.\n   - This can be done using the concept of \"gaps\" and combinatorial counting.\n\n4. **Find the remainder when $ N $ is divided by 1000:**\n   - Once we have calculated the number of valid subsets $ N $, we need to find the remainder when $ N $ is divided by 1000.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{N \\mod 1000}$.",
