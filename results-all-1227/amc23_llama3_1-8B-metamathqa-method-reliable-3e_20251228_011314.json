Since Alicia bikes at 18 miles per hour and Beth bikes at 12 miles per hour, they will meet at a distance of $18x$ from City $A$ and $12x$ from City $B$. Since the distance between the two cities is 45 miles, we have $18x + 12x = 45$. Simplifying, we get $30x = 45$, so $x = \\frac{45}{30} = \\frac{3}{2}$.
