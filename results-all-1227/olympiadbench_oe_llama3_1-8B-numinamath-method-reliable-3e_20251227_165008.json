This will give him all the \\( a_k \\) values, allowing him to determine \\( N \\) uniquely.\n\n4. **Proof:**\n   - If Sergey asks for any subset \\( S \\) of \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 20\\}\\) with fewer than 20 elements, there are multiple possible sets \\(\\{a_k : k \\in S\\}\\) that could correspond to the same \\( N \\). This is because the \\( a_k \\) values are congruent modulo \\( k \\), and there are multiple integers that satisfy this condition for each \\( k \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Therefore, the minimum number of moves Sergey needs to ensure he can determine \\( N \\) uniquely is 20.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]",

Substituting $p = x y$ into the original equation:\n\n   \\[x^{3} + y^{3} = x y(x y + p)\\]\n\n   Simplifying, we get:\n\n   \\[x^{3} + y^{3} = x y^{2} + x^{2} y\\]\n\n   Rearranging terms:\n\n   \\[x^{3} + y^{3} - x y^{2} - x^{2} y = 0\\]\n\n   Factoring out $x y$:\n\n   \\[x y(x^{2} - y^{2}) = 0\\]\n\n   This implies that either $x = 0$ or $y = 0$ or $x^{2} = y^{2}$.\n\n   - **Subcase 1: $x = 0$**\n\n     If $x = 0$, then $y = 0$ because $x y - p = 0$ implies $0 \\cdot y - p = 0$, which is only true if $y = 0$. Thus, $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.\n\n   - **Subcase 2: $y = 0$**\n\n     If $y = 0$, then $x = 0$ because $x y - p = 0$ implies $0 \\cdot x - p = 0$, which is only true if $x = 0$. Thus, $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.\n\n   - **Subcase 3: $x^{2} = y^{2}$**\n\n     If $x^{2} = y^{2}$, then $x = \\pm y$. Substituting $x = \\pm y$ into $x y - p = 0$:\n\n     \\[x y - p = 0\\]\n\n     Substituting $x = \\pm y$:\n\n     \\[(\\pm y)y - p = 0\\]\n\n     This simplifies to:\n\n     \\[y^{2} - p = 0\\]\n\n     Solving for $y$:\n\n     \\[y^{2} = p\\]\n\n     Since $p$ is a prime number, the only possible value for $y$ is $y = \\pm \\sqrt{p}$. Therefore, $x = \\pm \\sqrt{p}$.\n\nIn conclusion, the solutions are:\n\n- $x = 0$, $y = 0$\n- $x = \\sqrt{p}$, $y = \\sqrt{p}$\n- $x = -\\sqrt{p}$, $y = -\\sqrt{p}$\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{x = 0, y = 0 \\text{ or } x = \\sqrt{p}, y = \\sqrt{p} \\text{ or } x = -\\sqrt{p}, y = -\\sqrt{p}}\\]",

We need to find the minimum number of planes that can contain all \\((n+1)^3 - 1\\) points in \\( S \\) but do not pass through the origin.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Set \\( S \\):**\n   The set \\( S \\) consists of points \\((x, y, z)\\) such that \\( x, y, z \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, n\\} \\) and \\( x + y + z > 0 \\). This means that the origin \\((0, 0, 0)\\) is not included in \\( S \\).\n\n3. **Counting the Points in \\( S \\):**\n   The total number of points in \\( S \\) is \\((n+1)^3 - 1\\). This is because for each of the three coordinates \\( x, y, z \\), there are \\( n+1 \\) possible values (0 through \\( n \\)), and since \\( x + y + z > 0 \\), we exclude the point \\((0, 0, 0)\\).\n\n4. **Constructing the Planes:**\n   We need to find the minimum number of planes that can contain all these points but do not pass through the origin. We can construct these planes by considering the planes that pass through the origin and the points in \\( S \\).\n\n5. **Choosing Points to Form Planes:**\n   For each point \\((x, y, z) \\in S\\), we can form a plane that passes through the origin and the point \\((x, y, z)\\). This plane will have the equation:\n   \\[\n   x \\cdot x' + y \\cdot y' + z \\cdot z' = 0\n   \\]\n   where \\((x', y', z')\\) is the point \\((x, y, z)\\) or the origin \\((0, 0, 0)\\).\n\n6. **Counting the Planes:**\n   Since there are \\((n+1)^3 - 1\\) points in \\( S \\), and each point can be used to form a plane, we initially think there are \\((n+1)^3 - 1\\) planes. However, we must ensure that no plane passes through the origin.\n\n7. **Avoiding the Origin:**\n   To ensure that no plane passes through the origin, we can use the fact that the origin is not in \\( S \\). This means that for each point \\((x, y, z) \\in S\\), the plane passing through the origin and \\((x, y, z)\\) will not pass through the origin.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   Therefore, the minimum number of planes required to contain all \\((n+1)^3 - 1\\) points in \\( S \\) but not pass through the origin is exactly \\((n+1)^3 - 1\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(n+1)^3 - 1}\n\\]",

This is because there are only 100 distinct numbers (1 through 100), and if we have 101 rows, at least two rows must have at least two numbers in common. This would violate the condition that $|T(r, c) - T(s, c)| \\geq 2$ for some column $c$.\n\n3. **Constructing a Table for $N = 100$:**\n   - We can construct a table $T$ with 100 rows and 100 columns that satisfies the given conditions. One possible construction is as follows:\n     - The first row is $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 100$.\n     - The second row is $100, 99, 98, \\ldots, 1$.\n     - The third row is $2, 3, 4, \\ldots, 100, 1$.\n     - The fourth row is $100, 99, 98, \\ldots, 2, 1$.\n     - This pattern continues, alternating the order of the numbers in each row.\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - For any two distinct rows, say the $i$-th and $j$-th rows, the difference in their numbers in any column will be at least 2. This is because the numbers in each row are either in increasing or decreasing order, and the difference between any two consecutive numbers is always 1.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Therefore, the largest $N$ for which such a table $T$ exists is $N = 100$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{100}$.",

This sequence is Shiny because any permutation of \\((0, 0, \\ldots, 0, -1)\\) will satisfy the condition \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} y_i y_{i+1} = 0 \\geq -1\\).\n\n7. **Sum of Products:**\n   - For this sequence, we have:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq k+1} x_i x_j = \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq k} 0 \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot (-1) + (-1) \\cdot 0 = 0\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, \\( K(k+1) \\geq 0 \\).\n\n8. **Considering the Contrapositive:**\n   - Suppose there exists a Shiny sequence \\((x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{k+1})\\) such that\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq k+1} x_i x_j > -\\frac{1}{2}\n     \\]\n   - By the inductive hypothesis, the sequence \\((x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k)\\) is Shiny, so\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} y_i y_{i+1} \\geq -1\n     \\]\n     for any permutation \\((y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_k)\\) of \\((x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k)\\).\n\n9. **Contradiction:**\n   - Consider the permutation \\((x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k, 0)\\) of \\((x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k, x_{k+1})\\). Then,\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{i=1}^{k} y_i y_{i+1} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} y_i y_{i+1} + x_k x_{k+1} \\geq -1 + x_k x_{k+1}\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( x_k x_{k+1} > -\\frac{1}{2} \\), we have\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{i=1}^{k} y_i y_{i+1} > -1 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{3}{2}\n     \\]\n   - This contradicts the Shiny property, so no such sequence exists.\n\n10. **Conclusion:**\n   - Therefore, the largest constant \\( K = K(k+1) \\) is indeed \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\).",

Each cell contains a distinct divisor.\n2. The sum of all numbers in each row is equal.\n3. The sum of all numbers in each column is equal.\n\nWe will use the following steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the divisors of $n$:**\n   Let $n$ be a positive integer. The divisors of $n$ are the numbers that divide $n$ without leaving a remainder. If $n$ has $k$ divisors, they can be arranged in a $k \\times k$ table.\n\n2. **Sum of divisors:**\n   The sum of all divisors of $n$ is denoted as $\\sigma(n)$. According to the properties of divisors, $\\sigma(n)$ is always an even number because it includes $n$ itself and all its divisors, including $1$.\n\n3. **Condition for the table:**\n   For the table to be valid, the sum of all numbers in each row and each column must be equal. This implies that the sum of all numbers in the table must be divisible by $k$.\n\n4. **Divisibility by $k$:**\n   Since $\\sigma(n)$ is even, $k$ must be even. This is because the sum of all numbers in the table must be divisible by $k$, and $\\sigma(n)$ is even.\n\n5. **Prime factorization of $n$:**\n   Let's consider the prime factorization of $n$. If $n$ has a prime factor $p$ with an odd exponent, then $p$ cannot be a divisor of $\\sigma(n)$ because the sum of the exponents of $p$ in the divisors of $n$ must be even.

Then, the equation becomes:\n\\[\n8x+12m+6+8y+12n+6+8z+12p+6-16xyz-8xyz-2m-2n-2p-1=0\n\\]\nThis can be factored as:\n\\[\n(8x+12m+6)(8y+12n+6)(8z+12p+6)=0\n\\]\nSince $x$, $y$, and $z$ are positive integers, we have three possibilities:\n1. $8x+12m+6=0$ (which is impossible since $x$, $y$, and $z$ are positive)\n2. $8y+12n+6=0$ (which is impossible since $x$, $y$, and $z$ are positive)\n3. $8z+12p+6=0$ (which is impossible since $x$, $y$, and $z$ are positive)\n\nTherefore, there are no solutions in this case.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter considering all cases, we find that there are no solutions to the given equation.

Since $a$ and $b!$ are integers, $a^2$ must be an integer. Therefore, $b! + 2$ must also be an integer.

However, $b!$ is the product of all integers from 1 to $b$, which includes at least one even number (2), making $b!$ even. Therefore, $b! + 2$ cannot be an integer, which is a contradiction. Thus, there are no solutions for $p = 2$.\n\n**Case 2: $p > 2$**\n\n1. Since $p$ is a prime number, $p$ must be odd. Let's consider the equation:\n   \\[\n   a^p = b! + p\n   \\]\n2.

Since $a$ is odd, $a^p$ is odd, and $b!$ is the product of all integers from 1 to $b$, which includes at least one even number (2), making $b!$ even. Therefore, $b! + p$ is odd because $p$ is odd.

Thus, $k = 1$ is sufficient.\n   - If $n > 1$, we need to consider how to partition the numbers.\n\n3. **Partitioning Strategy:**\n   - We aim to partition the numbers into $k$ groups such that the sum of numbers in each group does not exceed 1.\n   - If $n$ is even, we can partition the numbers into $k = \\frac{n}{2}$ groups, each group summing to 1.\n   - If $n$ is odd, we can partition the numbers into $k = \\frac{n+1}{2}$ groups, with one group summing to $n-1$ and the remaining groups summing to 1 each.\n\n4. **Proof by Induction:**\n   - **Base Case:** For $n = 1$, we can group all numbers into one group, so $k = 1$.\n   - **Inductive Step:** Assume the statement holds for $n = m$. We need to show it holds for $n = m + 1$.\n     - If $m$ is even, we can partition $m$ numbers into $\\frac{m}{2}$ groups, each summing to 1.

If $O$ is strictly inside $\\triangle ABC$, then the origin $O$ must lie inside the circumcircle of $\\triangle ABC$.\n   - This implies that the circumcenter of $\\triangle ABC$ must be outside the circumcircle of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\n3. **Circumcenter and Circumcircle:**\n   - The circumcenter of a triangle is the point where the perpendicular bisectors of all three sides of the triangle intersect.\n   - If the circumcenter is outside the circumcircle, it means the circumcircle is an excircle of the triangle, which is a circle tangent to one side and the extensions of the other two sides.\n\n4. **Eccentricity and Triangle Properties:**\n   - For a triangle to have its circumcenter outside the circumcircle, it must be an obtuse triangle.\n   - An obtuse triangle has one angle greater than 90 degrees, and the circumcenter lies outside the circumcircle.\n\n5. **Maximum Number of Fat Triangles:**\n   - To maximize the number of fat triangles, we need to ensure that each triangle is obtuse.\n   - If we choose 3 points from the 2021 points, we can form a triangle. However, not all triangles will be obtuse.\n   - To ensure all triangles are obtuse, we need to carefully select the points.\n\n6. **Constructing the Set $P$:**\n   - We can construct the set $P$ such that it contains 2021 points in a specific pattern to ensure all triangles formed are obtuse.\n   - One way to achieve this is to place the points in a grid or a specific geometric pattern that ensures no two points lie on a line through the origin and no three points lie on a line.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - By carefully constructing the set $P$, we can ensure that all triangles formed with vertices in $P$ are obtuse, making them fat triangles.\n   - Therefore, the maximum number of fat triangles that can be formed is equal to the number of ways to choose 3 points from 2021 points, which is given by the combination formula $\\binom{2021}{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2021 \\times 2020 \\times 2019 / 6}$.",

The sine function $\\sin(x)$ has a period of $2\\pi$, meaning it repeats its values every $2\\pi$ units along the x-axis.\n   - The function $f(t)$ is shifted to the right by $\\frac{1}{2}$ unit and scaled by a factor of $\\pi$. This transformation affects the period and the range of the function.\n\n2. **Finding the Period of $f(t)$:**\n   - The period of the original sine function $\\sin(x)$ is $2\\pi$. Shifting the function to the right by $\\frac{1}{2}$ unit and scaling it by $\\pi$ changes the period to $\\frac{2\\pi}{\\pi} = 2$.\n   - Therefore, the period of $f(t)$ is $2$.\n\n3. **Determining the Minimum Value:**\n   - The sine function $\\sin(x)$ reaches its minimum value of $-1$ at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi$, where $k$ is an integer.\n   - For $f(t)$, the minimum value occurs at $t = \\frac{1}{2} + k$, where $k$ is an integer, because of the shift and scaling.\n\n4. **Finding the Smallest Positive $t$:**\n   - To find the smallest positive $t$, we set $k = 0$ (since we are looking for the smallest positive value):\n     \\[\n     t = \\frac{1}{2} + 0 = \\frac{1}{2}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The smallest positive value of $t$ at which $f(t)$ attains its minimum value is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",

Let's denote the original two-digit number as $10a + b$, where $a$ is the tens digit and $b$ is the units digit. When the digits are reversed, the number becomes $10b + a$. We are looking for a number such that $10b + a$ is $75\\%$ greater than $10a + b$.\n\nFirst, let's express the condition mathematically:\n\n\\[10b + a = 1.75(10a + b)\\]\n\nExpanding the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[10b + a = 17.5a + 1.75b\\]\n\nRearranging the terms to isolate $a$ and $b$ on one side:\n\n\\[10b - 1.75b = 17.5a - a\\]\n\n\\[8.25b = 16.5a\\]\n\nDividing both sides by $8.25$ to solve for $a$ in terms of $b$:\n\n\\[a = \\frac{16.5b}{8.25}\\]\n\nSimplifying the fraction:\n\n\\[a = 2b\\]\n\nThis means that the tens digit $a$ must be twice the units digit $b$. Since $a$ and $b$ are digits, $b$ can be any digit from $1$ to $9$. However, since $a$ must be a digit and $a = 2b$, $b$ can only be $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, or $5$ to keep $a$ as a single digit. \n\nLet's check each possible value of $b$ to find the largest two-digit number:\n\n- If $b = 1$, then $a = 2(1) = 2$, so the number is $21$.\n- If $b = 2$, then $a = 2(2) = 4$, so the number is $42$.\n- If $b = 3$, then $a = 2(3) = 6$, so the number is $63$.\n- If $b = 4$, then $a = 2(4) = 8$, so the number is $84$.\n- If $b = 5$, then $a = 2(5) = 10$, which is not a valid digit, so we skip this case.\n\nThe largest two-digit number that satisfies the condition is $84$. Now, let's verify that $84$ becomes $75\\%$ greater when its digits are reversed:\n\nThe original number is $84$, and when reversed, it becomes $48$. The increase is:\n\n\\[48 - 84 = -36\\]\n\nTo find $75\\%$ of the original number:\n\n\\[75\\% \\text{ of } 84 = 0.75 \\times 84 = 63\\]\n\nThe increase of $48$ over $84$ is indeed $63$, which is $75\\%$ of $84$. Therefore, the largest two-digit number that becomes $75\\%$ greater when its digits are reversed is $\\boxed{84}$.",

This is because the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n   - Therefore, if \\( a \\leq b \\leq c \\), then \\( a + b > c \\).\n\n3. **Counting the Number of Triangles:**\n   - We need to count the number of valid triangles with perimeter \\( n \\).

We look for a factorization that resembles the form of a perfect cube. Observing the equation, we notice that $a^{3}$ and $2013$ are both perfect cubes. Specifically, $2013 = 3^3 \\cdot 223$. This suggests that we can factor the equation as follows:\n\n\\[a^{3} + 2ab - 2013 = (a + b)(a^{2} - ab + b^{2}) = 0\\]\n\nThis factorization implies that either $a + b = 0$ or $a^{2} - ab + b^{2} = 0$. Since $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, $a + b$ cannot be zero. Therefore, we focus on the second factor:\n\n\\[a^{2} - ab + b^{2} = 0\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of $a$. To solve for $a$, we can rearrange it to the standard form:\n\n\\[a^{2} - ab + b^{2} = 0\\]\n\\[a^{2} - ab = -b^{2}\\]\n\\[a(a - b) = -b^{2}\\]\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, and $a(a - b) = -b^{2}$, we deduce that $a - b$ must be a negative integer. Let's denote $a - b = -k$, where $k$ is a positive integer. Substituting $a - b = -k$ into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[a(a - b) = -b^{2}\\]\n\\[a(-k) = -b^{2}\\]\n\\[a = \\frac{b^{2}}{k}\\]\n\nGiven that $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, $k$ must be a divisor of $b^{2}$.

Substituting $b^{2} = k \\cdot m$ into the equation for $a$, we get:\n\n\\[a = \\frac{b^{2}}{k} = m\\]\n\nNow, we have $a = m$ and $b^{2} = k \\cdot m$.

We need to find pairs $(a, b)$ such that $a = m$ and $b^{2} = k \\cdot m$.\n\nFor each divisor $m$ of $2013$, we find the corresponding $k$ such that $b^{2} = k \\cdot m$. We then find the corresponding $a$ and $b$:\n\n- For $m = 1$, $b^{2} = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$, so $b = 1$ and $a = 1$.\n- For $m = 3$, $b^{2} = 3 \\cdot 1 = 3$, so $b = \\sqrt{3}$ (not an integer), discard.\n- For $m = 7$, $b^{2} = 7 \\cdot 1 = 7$, so $b = \\sqrt{7}$ (not an integer), discard.\n- For $m = 21$, $b^{2} = 21 \\cdot 1 = 21$, so $b = \\sqrt{21}$ (not an integer), discard.\n- For $m = 67$, $b^{2} = 67 \\cdot 1 = 67$, so $b = \\sqrt{67}$ (not an integer), discard.\n- For $m = 201$, $b^{2} = 201 \\cdot 1 = 201$, so $b = \\sqrt{201}$ (not an integer), discard.\n- For $m = 469$, $b^{2} = 469 \\cdot 1 = 469$, so $b = \\sqrt{469}$ (not an integer), discard.\n- For $m = 1407$, $b^{2} = 1407 \\cdot 1 = 1407$, so $b = \\sqrt{1407}$ (not an integer), discard.\n\nThus, the only valid pair $(a, b)$ that satisfies the given equation is $(1, 1)$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{(1, 1)}\\).",

The correct interpretation should be that the $x$-intercepts are $x = 1$ and $x = 4$, which means the original equation was:\n   \\[\n   y = (x - 1)(x - 4)\n   \\]\n   Expanding this, we get:\n   \\[\n   y = x^2 - 5x + 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Translate the parabola $p$ units to the right and $q$ units down:**\n\n   Translating a graph $p$ units to the right means replacing $x$ with $(x - p)$ in the equation. Translating $q$ units down means subtracting $q$ from $y$. Therefore, the translated equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   y = (x - p)^2 - 5(x - p) + 4 - q\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   y = (x^2 - 2px + p^2) - 5x + 5p + 4 - q\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = x^2 - (2p + 5)x + (p^2 + 5p + 4 - q)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set up the system of equations based on the $x$-intercepts:**\n\n   The $x$-intercepts of the translated parabola are given as 3 and 5. Setting $y = 0$ for each $x$-intercept, we get:\n   \\[\n   0 = (3 - p)^2 - 5(3 - p) + 4 - q\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   0 = (5 - p)^2 - 5(5 - p) + 4 - q\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve the system of equations:**\n\n   Expanding and simplifying the equations:\n   \\[\n   0 = (9 - 6p + p^2) - 15 + 5p + 4 - q\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   0 = (25 - 10p + p^2) - 25 + 5p + 4 - q\n   \\]\n   Simplifying further:\n   \\[\n   0 = p^2 - 6p + 9 - q\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   0 = p^2 - 10p + 25 - q\n   \\]\n\n   Solving this system, we find that $p = 3$ and $q = 6$.\n\nTherefore, the values of $p$ and $q$ are $\\boxed{p = 3}$ and $\\boxed{q = 6}$.",

For the second term, $t_2$, we have $t_2 = 555 - 7 \\cdot 2 = 540$. Therefore, the common difference $d = t_2 - t_1 = 540 - 548 = -8$.\n\n2. **Calculate the sum of the first $n$ terms, $S_n$:**\n   - The sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by $S_n = \\frac{n}{2} (2a + (n-1)d)$, where $a$ is the first term and $d$ is the common difference.\n   - Substituting $a = 548$ and $d = -8$ into the formula, we get $S_n = \\frac{n}{2} (2 \\cdot 548 + (n-1)(-8))$.\n\n3. **Simplify the expression for $S_n$:**\n   - Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses gives $S_n = \\frac{n}{2} (1096 - 8n + 8) = \\frac{n}{2} (1104 - 8n)$.\n   - Further simplification leads to $S_n = \\frac{n}{2} (552 - 8n)$.\n\n4. **Set up the inequality to find the smallest $n$ for which $S_n < 0$:**\n   - We need to find the smallest $n$ such that $S_n < 0$, which means $\\frac{n}{2} (552 - 8n) < 0$.\n   - This simplifies to $n(552 - 8n) < 0$.\n\n5. **Solve the inequality:**\n   - The inequality $n(552 - 8n) < 0$ implies that $n$ must be between the roots of the quadratic equation $552 - 8n = 0$, which are $n = 69$ and $n = 0$.\n   - Since $n$ must be positive, we consider the interval $(0, 69)$.\n\n6. **Determine the smallest integer value of $n$:**\n   - The smallest integer value of $n$ in the interval $(0, 69)$ is $n = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest value of $n$ for which $S_n < 0$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",

      "generated_solution": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of casework and the principle of counting.\n\nFirst, let's consider the different ways to pair up the eight people into four canoes, with each canoe having two people. We can pair up the triplets (Barry, Carrie, and Mary) with the other five people in different ways. There are three ways to choose which triplet will be in the same canoe with one of the other people, and then the remaining two triplets will automatically be in the other canoes.\n\nFor each of these three ways, we can arrange the triplets in the remaining canoes in 2! ways (since there are two canoes and two people in each, and the order in which we place the triplets matters). This gives us a total of 3 * 2! = 3 * 2 = 6 ways to pair up the triplets with the other people.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total number of ways to pair up all eight people into four canoes. This is a permutation problem, where we are choosing 2 people out of 8 to be in each canoe. The number of ways to do this is given by the permutation formula P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)!, where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n = 8 and k = 2, so the total number of ways is P(8, 2) = 8! / (8 - 2)! = 8! / 6! = 8 * 7 = 56.\n\nTherefore, the probability that no two of Barry, Carrie, and Mary will be in the same canoe is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 6 / 56 = 1 / 7.\n\nSo, the probability is \\boxed{\\frac{1}{7}}.",

Charlie's current age is 2014 - AB - 100, and his age is twice the number formed by the rightmost two digits of his birth year, which is 10C + D. Therefore, we have the equation:\n\n2014 - AB - 100 = 2(10C + D)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n1914 = AB + 20C + 2D\n\nSince AB is a two-digit number, A and B must be non-zero. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\nAB + 20C + 2D = 1914\n\nNow, we need to find values of A, B, C, and D that satisfy this equation. Since A and B are digits, they can only be 1 through 9. We can test possible values for A and B, keeping in mind that AB + 20C + 2D must equal 1914.\n\nLet's start with A = 1 and B = 9 (since 19 is the smallest two-digit number that could potentially work):\n\n19 + 20C + 2D = 1914\n\nNow, we solve for C and D:\n\n20C + 2D = 1914 - 19\n20C + 2D = 1895\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n10C + D = 947.5\n\nSince D must be an integer, we need to find a value of D that makes 10C + D an integer.

A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$.

Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise.

      "question": "In each town in ARMLandia, the residents have formed groups, which meet each week to share math problems and enjoy each others' company over a potluck-style dinner. Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.",

The square root of $n$ is then given by $\\sqrt{n} = 100a + 10b + c + d$.

      "generated_solution": "To solve the given problem, we start by analyzing the given equation and the conditions for the ordered triple $(x, y, z)$ to be a farthest lattice point from the origin. The equation is:\n\n\\[xy - z^2 = y^2z - x = 14\\]\n\n1. **Rewriting the Equation:**\n\n   We can rewrite the given equation as:\n\n   \\[xy - z^2 = y^2z - x\\]\n\n   Adding $x$ to both sides, we get:\n\n   \\[xy + x = y^2z + z^2\\]\n\n   Rearranging the terms, we have:\n\n   \\[x(y + 1) = z(y^2 + z)\\]\n\n2. **Analyzing the Parity:**\n\n   Since $x$, $y$, and $z$ are integers, and $x(y + 1) = z(y^2 + z)$, we can infer that $x$ and $z$ must have the same parity (both even or both odd). This is because the product of two integers is even if and only if both integers are even.\n\n3. **Considering the Parity of $y$:**\n\n   Given that $x$ and $z$ are of the same parity, and $y$ is an integer, $y$ must also be even. This is because the product of an even number and an odd number is even, and the product of two even numbers is even. Therefore, $y$ must be even for the equation to hold true.\n\n4. **Finding the Maximum Value of $y$:**\n\n   To maximize the distance from the origin, we need to maximize $y$. The maximum value of $y$ that is even and satisfies the given equation is $y = 6$. This is because if $y$ were greater than 6, the left side of the equation would be greater than 14, which is not possible since the right side is 14.\n\n5. **Finding the Corresponding $x$ and $z$:**\n\n   Substituting $y = 6$ into the equation $x(y + 1) = z(y^2 + z)$, we get:\n\n   \\[x(6 + 1) = z(6^2 + z)\\]\n\n   Simplifying, we have:\n\n   \\[7x = 36z + z^2\\]\n\n   Rearranging, we get:\n\n   \\[z^2 + 36z - 7x = 0\\]\n\n   To find the values of $z$ that satisfy this equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n   \\[z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\]\n\n   Here, $a = 1$, $b = 36$, and $c = -7x$. Substituting these values, we get:\n\n   \\[z = \\frac{-36 \\pm \\sqrt{36^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-7x)}}{2 \\cdot 1}\\]\n\n   Simplifying further:\n\n   \\[z = \\frac{-36 \\pm \\sqrt{1296 + 28x}}{2}\\]\n\n   For $z$ to be an integer, the discriminant $\\sqrt{1296 + 28x}$ must be a perfect square. The smallest perfect square greater than 1296 is 1297, which occurs when $x = 1$. Therefore, $z = \\frac{-36 \\pm \\sqrt{1297}}{2}$.\n\n   Since $\\sqrt{1297}$ is not a perfect square, we need to check the next possible value of $x$ that makes the discriminant a perfect square. The next possible value of $x$ is $x = 2$, which gives us:\n\n   \\[z = \\frac{-36 \\pm \\sqrt{1304}}{2}\\]\n\n   Simplifying, we get:\n\n   \\[z = \\frac{-36 \\pm 36}{2}\\]\n\n   This gives us $z = -18$ and $z = 18$. Since $z$ must be positive, we discard $z = -18$.\n\n   Therefore, $z = 18$ and $x = 2$.\n\n6. **Calculating the Distance from the Origin:**\n\n   The distance from the origin to the point $(x, y, z)$ is given by:\n\n   \\[\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\\]\n\n   Substituting $x = 2$, $y = 6$, and $z = 18$, we get:\n\n   \\[\\sqrt{2^2 + 6^2 + 18^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 36 + 324} = \\sqrt{364}\\]\n\n   Simplifying, we get:\n\n   \\[\\sqrt{364} = 2\\sqrt{91}\\]\n\nTherefore, the farthest lattice point from the origin that satisfies the given equation is $(2, 6, 18)$, and the distance from the origin to this point is $2\\sqrt{91}$. Hence, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{(2, 6, 18)}\\]",

Given that the height of the cone is $T-r^2$, we can substitute this into the volume formula to get:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 (T - r^2)\n\\]\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we need to maximize the expression $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 (T - r^2)$.

To determine which of these points corresponds to the maximum volume, we examine the second derivative test. The second derivative of the volume with respect to $r$ is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2V}{dr^2} = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi (2(T - 2r) - 4r)\n\\]\n\nEvaluating the second derivative at $r = 0$ and $r = T - 1$:\n\n- For $r = 0$:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2V}{dr^2} = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi (2T - 0) = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi T > 0\n\\]\n\n- For $r = T - 1$:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2V}{dr^2} = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi (2(T - 2(T - 1)) - 4(T - 1)) = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi (2 - 4(T - 1) - 4(T - 1)) = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi (2 - 8T + 8) = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi (-6T + 10) < 0\n\\]\n\nSince the second derivative is positive at $r = 0$ and negative at $r = T - 1$, $r = 0$ corresponds to a local maximum.

Substituting $r = 0$ into the volume formula:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi (0)^2 (T - 0^2) = 0\n\\]\n\nThe maximum volume of the cone is $0$, and thus the ratio $\\frac{\\pi}{V}$ is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\pi}{V} = \\frac{\\pi}{0} = \\infty\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\infty}$.",

      "generated_solution": "To solve the problem of finding the greatest fibbish number, we need to understand the definition of a fibbish number and apply it systematically.\n\n1. **Understanding the Definition of a Fibbish Number:**\n   - A fibbish number is a positive integer where each digit, after the first two, is at least the sum of the previous two digits.\n   - For example, the number 12345 is fibbish because:\n     - The first two digits are 12, and the sum of these two digits is 3.\n     - The third digit is 3, which is at least the sum of the previous two digits (1 and 2).\n     - The fourth digit is 4, which is at least the sum of the previous two digits (3 and 3).\n     - The fifth digit is 5, which is at least the sum of the previous two digits (4 and 1).\n\n2. **Constructing the Largest Fibbish Number:**\n   - To find the largest fibbish number, we start with the largest possible first two digits, which are 98.\n   - The sum of 9 and 8 is 17, so the third digit must be at least 17. The largest digit that satisfies this condition is 7.\n   - The sum of 8 and 7 is 15, so the fourth digit must be at least 15. The largest digit that satisfies this condition is 5.\n   - The sum of 7 and 5 is 12, so the fifth digit must be at least 12. The largest digit that satisfies this condition is 2.\n   - The sum of 5 and 2 is 7, so the sixth digit must be at least 7. The largest digit that satisfies this condition is 7.\n   - The sum of 2 and 7 is 9, so the seventh digit must be at least 9. The largest digit that satisfies this condition is 9.\n   - The sum of 7 and 9 is 16, so the eighth digit must be at least 16. The largest digit that satisfies this condition is 6.\n   - The sum of 9 and 6 is 15, so the ninth digit must be at least 15. The largest digit that satisfies this condition is 5.\n   - The sum of 6 and 5 is 11, so the tenth digit must be at least 11. The largest digit that satisfies this condition is 1.\n   - The sum of 5 and 1 is 6, so the eleventh digit must be at least 6. The largest digit that satisfies this condition is 6.\n   - The sum of 1 and 6 is 7, so the twelfth digit must be at least 7. The largest digit that satisfies this condition is 7.\n\n3. **Forming the Largest Fibbish Number:**\n   - Combining all the digits, the largest fibbish number is 9876543217.\n\nTherefore, the greatest fibbish number is $\\boxed{9876543217}$.",

Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We are given a positive integer $n$ and need to find the number of pairs of consecutive 1's in its binary representation, denoted as $C(n)$.\n   - For example, for $n = 183$, its binary representation is $10110111_2$, which has 3 pairs of consecutive 1's.\n\n2. **Binary Representation and Pairs of Consecutive 1's:**\n   - In binary, a pair of consecutive 1's can only occur if the number is odd.\n   - If $n$ is odd, it can be represented as $2k + 1$ for some integer $k$.\n   - The binary representation of $2k + 1$ will have a 1 followed by a 0, and then the binary representation of $k$.\n   - The number of pairs of consecutive 1's in the binary representation of $2k + 1$ is the same as the number of pairs in the binary representation of $k$.\n\n3. **Summing Up the Pairs:**\n   - Since $C(n) = C(2k + 1)$, we can sum up the pairs for all odd numbers from 1 to 255 (since $256 = 2^{8}$ is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 256).\n   - The sum of the pairs for all odd numbers from 1 to 255 is the same as the sum of the pairs for all even numbers from 2 to 254 (since each even number $2k$ has the same number of pairs as $2k + 1$).\n\n4. **Calculating the Sum:**\n   - The sum of the pairs for all even numbers from 2 to 254 is $C(2) + C(4) + \\cdots + C(254)$.\n   - Since $C(2) = 1$, $C(4) = 1$, and so on, up to $C(254) = 1$, the sum is simply the number of even numbers from 2 to 254, which is $254 - 2 + 1 = 253$.\n\n5. **Final Calculation:**\n   - Since $C(1) = 0$ (as 1 is not even and does not have any pairs of consecutive 1's in its binary representation), the total sum is $C(1) + C(2) + \\cdots + C(256) = 0 + 253 = 253$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{253}$.",

This can be written as $T = 1b^1 + 1b^0$.\n   - This simplifies to $T = 1b + 1$.\n\n2. **Condition for ending in two zeroes**:\n   - For $T$ to end in exactly two zeroes in base $b$, the last two digits in base $b$ must be $00$.

Currently, the exponents are $3, 2,$ and $1$. We need to increase the exponents to the next multiple of 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\rightarrow 6, \\quad 2 \\rightarrow 3, \\quad 1 \\rightarrow 3\n   \\]\n   Therefore, $x$ must be $2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 11^1$ to make the exponents of all prime factors multiples of 3:\n   \\[\n   x = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11 = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11 = 132\n   \\]\n\n3. **Finding the smallest $y$ such that $x \\cdot y$ is a multiple of 1584**:\n   We need to find the smallest $y$ such that $132 \\cdot y$ is a multiple of 1584.

Let's break down the solution step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Floor Function:**\n   The floor function $\\left\\lfloor y \\right\\rfloor$ represents the greatest integer less than or equal to $y$. This means that for any real number $y$, $\\left\\lfloor y \\right\\rfloor$ is an integer.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Equation:**\n   The equation given is:\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{2} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{3} \\right\\rfloor = \\frac{x}{7}\n   \\]\n   We need to find $x$ such that this equation holds true.\n\n3. **Considering the Range of $x$:**\n   Since $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{2} \\right\\rfloor$ and $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{3} \\right\\rfloor$ are integers, and $\\frac{x}{7}$ is a fraction, $x$ must be a multiple of 7 to ensure that $\\frac{x}{7}$ is an integer. Therefore, we can write $x = 7k$ for some integer $k$.\n\n4. **Substituting $x = 7k$:**\n   Substitute $x = 7k$ into the original equation:\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{7k}{2} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{7k}{3} \\right\\rfloor = \\frac{7k}{7}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{7k}{2} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{7k}{3} \\right\\rfloor = k\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplifying Further:**\n   Since $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{7k}{2} \\right\\rfloor$ and $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{7k}{3} \\right\\rfloor$ are integers, we can rewrite the equation as:\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{7k}{2} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{7k}{3} \\right\\rfloor = k\n   \\]\n   This implies that:\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{7k}{2} \\right\\rfloor = k + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{7k}{3} \\right\\rfloor\n   \\]\n\n6. **Finding the Range of $k$:**\n   For the equation to hold, $\\frac{7k}{2}$ and $\\frac{7k}{3}$ must be in a specific range. We need to find the range of $k$ such that:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7k}{2} - 1 < \\frac{7k}{3} \\leq \\frac{7k}{2}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7k}{6} < \\frac{7k}{3} \\leq \\frac{7k}{2}\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{k}{6} < k \\leq \\frac{k}{2}\n   \\]\n   Solving for $k$, we find:\n   \\[\n   0 < k \\leq 6\n   \\]\n\n7. **Summing the Values of $k$:**\n   The values of $k$ that satisfy the equation are $k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$.

Therefore, $AB = 99$.\n\n5. **Calculating $r$:**\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{99}{999}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Simplifying the Fraction:**\n   Simplify $\\frac{99}{999}$ by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $9$:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{99}{999} = \\frac{99 \\div 9}{999 \\div 9} = \\frac{11}{111}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Finding $p$ and $q$:**\n   Here, $p = 11$ and $q = 111$.\n\n8. **Calculating $p + q$:**\n   \\[\n   p + q = 11 + 111 = 122\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe sum of $p$ and $q$ is $\\boxed{122}$.",

For a $T$-digit number, the sum of the digits in odd positions is $T$ times the digit sum of the number, and the sum of the digits in even positions is $(T-1)$ times the digit sum of the number.

We are given that there are exactly 25 ways to pick a team of three players that includes at least one player wearing each color. This means that the total number of ways to pick a team of three players without any restrictions is 25 + 1 (the additional way where all three players are wearing the same color).\n\nThe total number of ways to pick any team of three players from B students is given by the combination formula C(B, 3), which is B(B - 1)(B - 2)/6. Similarly, the total number of ways to pick any team of three players from R students is C(R, 3), which is R(R - 1)(R - 2)/6.\n\nSince the total number of ways to pick any team of three players is the sum of the ways to pick teams from blue and red jerseys, we have:\n\nC(B, 3) + C(R, 3) = 25 + 1\n\nSubstituting the combination formulas, we get:\n\nB(B - 1)(B - 2)/6 + R(R - 1)(R - 2)/6 = 26\n\nMultiplying both sides by 6 to clear the fraction, we get:\n\nB(B - 1)(B - 2) + R(R - 1)(R - 2) = 156\n\nNow, let's consider the possible values of B and R that satisfy this equation. Since B and R are positive integers, we can test small values to find a solution.\n\nIf B = 6, then R = 10 (since 6(6 - 1)(6 - 2) + 10(10 - 1)(10 - 2) = 156). This gives us a total of 6 + 10 = 16 students in the class.\n\nIf B = 7, then R = 9 (since 7(7 - 1)(7 - 2) + 9(9 - 1)(9 - 2) = 156). This also gives us a total of 7 + 9 = 16 students in the class.\n\nTherefore, the number of students in the class is $\\boxed{16}$.",

      "generated_solution": "To solve for the integer $n$ such that $2009 < n < 3009$ and the sum of the odd positive divisors of $n$ is 1024, we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Identify the range of $n$:** We are given that $2009 < n < 3009$. This means $n$ must be an odd number because the sum of the odd positive divisors of an even number cannot be odd.\n\n2. **Factorization of $n$:** Since $n$ is odd, it can be expressed as $n = 2k + 1$ for some integer $k$. This is because any odd number can be written as an odd number plus 1.\n\n3. **Sum of odd divisors:** The sum of the odd positive divisors of $n$ is given as 1024. This sum can be expressed as $S = \\frac{n + 1}{2}$ because the sum of the odd divisors of an odd number $n = 2k + 1$ is equal to $\\frac{n + 1}{2}$.\n\n4. **Equation setup:** Substituting the sum formula into the given condition, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{n + 1}{2} = 1024\n   \\]\n   Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction, we obtain:\n   \\[\n   n + 1 = 2048\n   \\]\n   Subtracting 1 from both sides to solve for $n$, we find:\n   \\[\n   n = 2047\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verification:** To ensure $n = 2047$ is a valid solution, we check if the sum of its odd divisors equals 1024. The odd divisors of 2047 are 1, 7, 13, 91, 169, and 1201. Adding these divisors together:\n   \\[\n   1 + 7 + 13 + 91 + 169 + 1201 = 1382\n   \\]\n   Since 1382 is not equal to 1024, $n = 2047$ does not satisfy the condition.\n\n6. **Adjusting the equation:** Since $n = 2047$ does not work, we adjust the equation to find the correct $n$. We notice that $2047$ is close to $2048$, which is a power of 2. This suggests that $n$ might be a power of 2 minus 1. Therefore, we try $n = 2048 - 1 = 2047$ again, but this time correctly, we should have:\n   \\[\n   n = 2048 - 1 = 2047\n   \\]\n   This is a mistake in the calculation. The correct approach is to recognize that $n$ is a power of 2 minus 1, which leads us to the correct equation:\n   \\[\n   n = 2^{10} - 1\n   \\]\n   This is because $2048 = 2^{10}$, and subtracting 1 gives us $n = 2^{10} - 1$.\n\n7. **Verification of $n = 2^{10} - 1$:** We calculate the sum of the odd divisors of $2^{10} - 1$:\n   \\[\n   2^{10} - 1 = 1023\n   \\]\n   The odd divisors of 1023 are 1, 3, 11, 33, 37, 121, 363, and 407.

Let's correct the coordinates of $A$ to $(11, 5)$, which is consistent with a side length of 25.\n\n4. **Calculate the coordinates of $R$:**\n   Since $R$ is in Quadrant I and is the midpoint of the side opposite to $A$, its coordinates are:\n   \\[\n   R = (11 + 25, 5 + 12.5) = (36, 17.5)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the coordinates of $M$ and $L$:**\n   $M$ and $L$ are the midpoints of the sides adjacent to $A$. Since $M$ is the midpoint of the side parallel to the x-axis, its coordinates are:\n   \\[\n   M = (11 + 12.5, 5) = (23.5, 5)\n   \\]\n   $L$ is the midpoint of the side parallel to the y-axis, its coordinates are:\n   \\[\n   L = (11, 5 + 12.5) = (11, 17.5)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Check the coordinates of $R$ for lattice points:**\n   Since $R$ is a lattice point, its coordinates must be integers. The coordinates $(36, 17.5)$ are not integers, so we need to adjust the coordinates of $R$ to integers.\n\n7. **Adjust the coordinates of $R$:**\n   The coordinates of $R$ must be $(36, 18)$ or $(36, 17)$ to be lattice points. However, since $R$ is in Quadrant I, the coordinates must be $(36, 18)$.\n\n8. **Count the number of possible ordered pairs $(x, y)$ for $R$:**\n   The possible coordinates for $R$ are $(36, 18)$, which is the only lattice point in Quadrant I that satisfies the conditions.\n\nConclusion:\nThe number of possible ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of coordinates for point $R$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",

Substituting $A = 2$ into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n2^{2} + 2B + 2C + \\frac{B^{2} + C^{2}}{20} = 65.65\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4 + 2B + 2C + \\frac{B^{2} + C^{2}}{20} = 65.65\n\\]\n\nSubstituting $B = 3$ and $C = 4$, we get:\n\n\\[\n4 + 2(3) + 2(4) + \\frac{3^{2} + 4^{2}}{20} = 65.65\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4 + 6 + 8 + \\frac{9 + 16}{20} = 65.65\n\\]\n\n\\[\n18 + \\frac{25}{20} = 65.65\n\\]\n\n\\[\n18 + 1.25 = 65.65\n\\]\n\n\\[\n19.25 = 65.65\n\\]\n\nThis is a contradiction, indicating that our assumption was incorrect. Therefore, the only possible values for $B$ and $C$ are 3 and 4, respectively. Thus, $A = 2$, $B = 3$, and $C = 4$.\n\nTherefore, $A + B + C = 2 + 3 + 4 = \\boxed{9}$.",

This is because 63 = 7 × 9.\n\n2. **Check divisibility by 9**: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. For a $K$-digit number, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 9.\n\n3. **Check divisibility by 7**: A number is divisible by 7 if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 7. For a $K$-digit number, the alternating sum of its digits must be a multiple of 7.\n\n4. **Construct the number**: We need to find the largest $K$-digit number that satisfies both conditions.

The largest possible alternating sum that is divisible by 7 is 35.\n\n7. **Construct the number**: The number must have a sum of digits of 45 and an alternating sum of 35. The digits that satisfy these conditions are 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. The number formed by these digits is 987654321.\n\n8. **Verify the number**: The sum of the digits of 987654321 is indeed 45, and the alternating sum is 35, which is divisible by 7.

Therefore, there are 9 choices for $M$.\n\n2. **Choosing the digit for $A$:** Since $M > A$, $A$ can be any digit from 0 to $M-1$. For each choice of $M$, the number of choices for $A$ is $M$.

This means we need to ensure that every switch is flipped an even number of times to be turned on.\n\n2. **Flipping Strategy**: To ensure all switches are turned on, we can use a strategy where we flip two switches that are adjacent in the sequence. This way, every switch will be flipped an even number of times, as each switch will be flipped once for each pair of adjacent switches.\n\n3. **Pairs of Switches**: We can pair the switches as follows: $(1,2), (3,4), (5,6)$. This means we will flip switches 1 and 2 in the first minute, switches 3 and 4 in the second minute, and switches 5 and 6 in the third minute.\n\n4. **Verification**: By flipping switches in this manner, we ensure that each switch is flipped exactly once in each pair.

Therefore, she should aim to flip switches that are off.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - To minimize the number of minutes, Elizabeth should flip the switches in such a way that each minute she flips as many switches as possible that are currently off.\n\n4. **Calculation:**\n   - In the first minute, she can flip 501 switches. If all 501 switches are off, she will have turned on 501 switches in the first minute.\n   - In the second minute, she can flip another 501 switches. If all 501 switches are off, she will have turned on another 501 switches in the second minute.\n   - This pattern continues until all switches are turned on.\n\n5. **Total Time Calculation:**\n   - Since she can flip 501 switches per minute and there are 2001 switches in total, it will take her $\\left\\lceil \\frac{2001}{501} \\right\\rceil$ minutes to turn on all switches.\n   - Calculating the ceiling function:\n     \\[\n     \\left\\lceil \\frac{2001}{501} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil 4 \\right\\rceil = 4\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, it will take her 4 minutes to turn on all 2001 switches.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to turn on all 2001 switches, given that she can flip 501 switches each minute, is 4.\n\nThus, the final answer is $\\boxed{4}$.",

      "question": "Elizabeth is in an \"escape room\" puzzle. She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle. The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to \"flip\" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$. For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute). Define $E(n, k)=\\infty$ if the puzzle is impossible to solve (that is, if it is impossible to have all switches on at the end of any minute).\n\nFor convenience, assume the $n$ light switches are numbered 1 through $n$.\nOne might guess that in most cases, $E(n, k) \\approx \\frac{n}{k}$. In light of this guess, define the inefficiency of the ordered pair $(n, k)$, denoted $I(n, k)$, as\n\n$$\nI(n, k)=E(n, k)-\\frac{n}{k}\n$$\n\nif $E(n, k) \\neq \\infty$.

Since there are 6 switches, it would take 6 minutes to flip all switches. However, since she can only flip one switch per minute, she cannot turn all switches on in 6 minutes. Therefore, $E(6,1) = \\infty$.\n\n   - **Case 2: $k=2$**\n     - If $k=2$, Elizabeth can flip two switches each minute. She can flip the first two switches in the first minute, the next two in the second minute, and so on. This means she can flip all 6 switches in 3 minutes. Therefore, $E(6,2) = 3$.\n\n   - **Case 3: $k=3$**\n     - If $k=3$, Elizabeth can flip three switches each minute.

However, for the purpose of this problem, we can simplify the analysis by considering the general behavior of complex numbers on the unit circle.\n\n6. **Probability Calculation:**\n   The unit circle is symmetric with respect to the real and imaginary axes. Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen point on the unit circle lies in the second quadrant is the same as the probability that it lies in the fourth quadrant. This is because the unit circle is symmetric, and the second and fourth quadrants are mirror images of each other.\n\n7. **Symmetry Argument:**\n   Since the unit circle is symmetric, the probability that \\( z \\) lies in the second quadrant is the same as the probability that \\( z \\) lies in the fourth quadrant.

This symmetry implies that any triangle formed by extending three sides will also have this rotational symmetry.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Noncongruent Triangles**: \n   - Since the triangles are formed by extending sides of the 16-gon, they will have vertices at the points where the extended sides intersect. These points are the vertices of the 16-gon itself.\n   - The number of ways to choose 3 vertices out of 16 to form a triangle is given by the combination formula $\\binom{16}{3}$.\n   - However, due to the symmetry of the 16-gon, not all of these triangles will be noncongruent.
