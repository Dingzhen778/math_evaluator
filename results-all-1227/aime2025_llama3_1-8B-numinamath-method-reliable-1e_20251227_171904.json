      "generated_solution": "1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   We need to find the sum of all integer bases $b > 9$ for which $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b$. This means we need to find bases $b$ such that $17_b$ divides $97_b$.\n\n2. **Expressing $17_b$ and $97_b$ in Decimal:**\n   - $17_b$ in decimal is $1b + 7$.\n   - $97_b$ in decimal is $9b + 7$.\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation:**\n   Since $17_b$ divides $97_b$, we have:\n   \\[\n   1b + 7 \\mid 9b + 7\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this, we get:\n   \\[\n   1b + 7 \\mid 8b\n   \\]\n   This implies:\n   \\[\n   1b + 7 \\mid 8b - 7b = b\n   \\]\n\n4. **Finding Possible Values of $b$:**\n   For $1b + 7$ to divide $b$, $b$ must be a multiple of $1b + 7$. We need to find the values of $b$ such that $1b + 7$ divides $b$.\n\n5. **Checking Possible Values:**\n   - For $b = 16$, $1b + 7 = 23$ divides $16$.\n   - For $b = 23$, $1b + 7 = 30$ divides $23$.\n   - For $b = 30$, $1b + 7 = 37$ divides $30$.\n   - For $b = 37$, $1b + 7 = 44$ divides $37$.\n   - For $b = 44$, $1b + 7 = 51$ does not divide $44$.\n   - For $b = 51$, $1b + 7 = 58$ does not divide $51$.\n   - For $b = 58$, $1b + 7 = 65$ does not divide $58$.\n   - For $b = 65$, $1b + 7 = 72$ does not divide $65$.\n   - For $b = 72$, $1b + 7 = 79$ does not divide $72$.\n   - For $b = 79$, $1b + 7 = 86$ does not divide $79$.\n\n6. **Summing Valid Values:**\n   The valid values of $b$ are $16$, $23$, $30$, and $37$. Their sum is:\n   \\[\n   16 + 23 + 30 + 37 = 106\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{106}$.",

Since there are 6 pairs, the total number of arrangements of the pairs is:\n   \\[\n   2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Arrangements of Words**: The total number of ways to arrange the 6 pairs into 6 words is:\n   \\[\n   6! = 720\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Arrangements Including $G$ in the Last Word**: To find the number of arrangements where $G$ is in the last word, we first choose 5 letters from the remaining 11 letters (excluding $G$) to form the first 5 words. The number of ways to choose 5 letters from 11 is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{11}{5} = 462\n   \\]\n   Then, we arrange these 5 letters in 5 positions (excluding the last position), which can be done in:\n   \\[\n   5! = 120\n   \\]\n   Finally, we place $G$ in the last position, which can be done in 1 way.

      "generated_solution": "1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have an 11-sided non-convex simple polygon \\( A_1A_2 \\ldots A_{11} \\).\n   - The area of each triangle \\( A_iA_1A_{i+1} \\) is 1 for \\( 2 \\leq i \\leq 10 \\).\n   - The cosine of the angle \\( \\angle A_iA_1A_{i+1} \\) is \\(\\frac{12}{13}\\) for \\( 2 \\leq i \\leq 10 \\).\n   - The perimeter of the polygon is 20.\n\n2. **Calculating the Area of the Polygon:**\n   - The area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the 10 triangles:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = 10 \\times 1 = 10\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the Perimeter:**\n   - The perimeter of the polygon is given as 20. Let's denote the side lengths as \\( a_i \\) for \\( 1 \\leq i \\leq 11 \\).\n\n4. **Using the Cosine Formula:**\n   - The cosine of the angle \\( \\angle A_iA_1A_{i+1} \\) is given as \\(\\frac{12}{13}\\). Using the cosine formula for a triangle, we have:\n     \\[\n     \\cos \\angle A_iA_1A_{i+1} = \\frac{a_i^2 + a_{i+1}^2 - a_1^2}{2a_i a_{i+1}}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\(\\cos \\angle A_iA_1A_{i+1} = \\frac{12}{13}\\), we get:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{a_i^2 + a_{i+1}^2 - a_1^2}{2a_i a_{i+1}} = \\frac{12}{13}\n     \\]\n   - Multiplying both sides by \\(2a_i a_{i+1}\\) and rearranging, we get:\n     \\[\n     a_i^2 + a_{i+1}^2 - a_1^2 = \\frac{24}{13} a_i a_{i+1}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Summing the Equations:**\n   - Summing the above equation for \\( 2 \\leq i \\leq 10 \\), we get:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{i=2}^{10} (a_i^2 + a_{i+1}^2 - a_1^2) = \\frac{24}{13} \\sum_{i=2}^{10} a_i a_{i+1}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{i=2}^{10} a_i^2 + \\sum_{i=2}^{10} a_{i+1}^2 - 10a_1^2 = \\frac{24}{13} \\sum_{i=2}^{10} a_i a_{i+1}\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( \\sum_{i=2}^{10} a_i^2 = 10 \\) (sum of the areas of the triangles), we have:\n     \\[\n     10 + 10 - 10a_1^2 = \\frac{24}{13} \\sum_{i=2}^{10} a_i a_{i+1}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying further, we get:\n     \\[\n     10 = \\frac{24}{13} \\sum_{i=2}^{10} a_i a_{i+1}\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( \\sum_{i=2}^{10} a_i a_{i+1} \\), we get:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{i=2}^{10} a_i a_{i+1} = \\frac{130}{24} = \\frac{65}{12}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Calculating the Perimeter:**\n   - The perimeter of the polygon is given as 20. Let's denote the side lengths as \\( a_i \\) for \\( 1 \\leq i \\leq 11 \\). The perimeter is:\n     \\[\n     a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \\ldots + a_{11} = 20\n     \\]\n   - Using the formula for the sum of the first \\( n \\) terms of an arithmetic series, we have:\n     \\[\n     a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \\ldots + a_{11} = 11 \\times \\frac{a_1 + a_{11}}{2} = 20\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( a_1 + a_{11} \\), we get:\n     \\[\n     a_1 + a_{11} = \\frac{40}{11}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Finding \\( a_1 \\) and \\( a_{11} \\):**\n   - Let \\( a_1 = x \\) and \\( a_{11} = y \\). Then:\n     \\[\n     x + y = \\frac{40}{11}\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( a_1 = a_{11} \\), we have:\n     \\[\n     x = y = \\frac{20}{11}\n     \\]\n\n8. **Calculating \\( a_2 \\) and \\( a_10 \\):**\n   - Using the cosine formula, we have:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{a_2^2 + a_3^2 - a_1^2}{2a_2 a_3} = \\frac{12}{13}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\( a_1 = \\frac{20}{11} \\), we get:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{a_2^2 + a_3^2 - \\left(\\frac{20}{11}\\right)^2}{2a_2 a_3} = \\frac{12}{13}\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( a_2 \\) and \\( a_3 \\), we get:\n     \\[\n     a_2 = a_3 = \\frac{20}{11}\n     \\]\n\n9. **Calculating \\( a_3 \\) and \\( a_9 \\):**\n   - Similarly, using the cosine formula for \\( a_3 \\) and \\( a_9 \\), we get:\n     \\[\n     a_3 = a_9 = \\frac{20}{11}\n     \\]\n\n10. **Calculating \\( a_4 \\) and \\( a_8 \\):**\n    - Using the cosine formula for \\( a_4 \\) and \\( a_8 \\), we get:\n      \\[\n      a_4 = a_8 = \\frac{20}{11}\n      \\]\n\n11. **Calculating \\( a_5 \\) and \\( a_7 \\):**\n    - Using the cosine formula for \\( a_5 \\) and \\( a_7 \\), we get:\n      \\[\n      a_5 = a_7 = \\frac{20}{11}\n      \\]\n\n12. **Calculating \\( a_6 \\) and \\( a_10 \\):**\n    - Using the cosine formula for \\( a_6 \\) and \\( a_10 \\), we get:\n      \\[\n      a_6 = a_10 = \\frac{20}{11}\n      \\]\n\n13. **Calculating \\( a_1A_2 + a_1A_{11} \\):**\n    - Since \\( a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = \\ldots = a_{11} = \\frac{20}{11} \\), we have:\n      \\[\n      a_1A_2 + a_1A_{11} = 2a_1 = 2 \\times \\frac{20}{11} = \\frac{40}{11}\n      \\]\n\n14. **Expressing the Result:**\n    - The expression \\( a_1A_2 + a_1A_{11} \\) can be expressed as:\n      \\[\n      \\frac{40}{11}\n      \\]\n\n15. **Conclusion:**\n    - The final answer is:\n      \\[\n      m + n + p + q = 40 + 11 + 0 + 11 = \\boxed{62}\n      \\]",
