      "generated_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Janet's running total equals 3 at some point during her four rolls of a standard 6-sided die.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the possible outcomes for each roll:**\n   Each roll of a 6-sided die can result in one of the numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n\n2. **Determine the running total after each roll:**\n   Let \\( S_n \\) represent the running total after \\( n \\) rolls. We need to find the probability that \\( S_n = 3 \\) for some \\( n \\) in the range \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 4 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the probability of reaching a running total of 3:**\n   - **After 1 roll:** The only way to get a running total of 3 is to roll a 3. The probability of this happening is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n\n   - **After 2 rolls:** The possible combinations of two rolls that sum to 3 are (1, 2) and (2, 1). The probability of each combination occurring is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{6}} = \\frac{1}{36} \\). Since there are two combinations, the total probability is \\( 2 \\times \\frac{1}{36}} = \\frac{2}{36} = \\frac{1}{18} \\).\n\n   - **After 3 rolls:** The possible combinations of three rolls that sum to 3 are (1, 1, 1). The probability of this combination occurring is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{6}} = \\frac{1}{216} \\).\n\n   - **After 4 rolls:** The possible combinations of four rolls that sum to 3 are (1, 1, 1, 0) and permutations thereof. However, since the die only has faces from 1 to 6, it is impossible to achieve a running total of 3 after 4 rolls.\n\n4. **Sum the probabilities of reaching a running total of 3 at any point during the four rolls:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{18} + \\frac{1}{216}} = \\frac{36}{216} + \\frac{12}{216} + \\frac{1}{216}} = \\frac{49}{216}}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the final probability:**\n   The probability that Janet's running total equals 3 at some point during her four rolls is \\( \\frac{49}{216}} \\).\n\n6. **Find the sum of the numerator and the denominator:**\n   \\[\n   49 + 216 = 265\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{265}\n\\]",
