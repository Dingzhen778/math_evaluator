Additionally, we need to determine how many of these values of \\( x \\) result in the graph of \\( y = f(x) \\) being tangent to the \\( x \\)-axis.\n\n### Step 1: Determine when \\( f(x) = 0 \\)\n\nThe function \\( f(x) = \\sin(7\\pi \\cdot \\sin(5x))) \\) equals zero when the argument of the sine function is an integer multiple of \\( \\pi \\). Therefore, we need to solve:\n\\[\n7\\pi \\cdot \\sin(5x) = k\\pi \\quad \\text{for some integer } k.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n7 \\sin(5x) = k.\n\\]\nSince \\( \\sin(5x) \\) ranges from \\(-1\\) to \\(1\\), \\( 7 \\sin(5x) \\) ranges from \\(-7\\) to \\(7\\). Therefore, \\( k \\) must be an integer between \\(-7\\) and \\(7\\).\n\n### Step 2: Count the number of solutions \\( n \\)\n\nFor each integer \\( k \\) in the range \\(-7 \\leq k \\leq 7\\), we need to count the number of solutions to:\n\\[\n\\sin(5x) = \\frac{k}{7}.\n\\]\nThe function \\( \\sin(5x) \\) has a period of \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{5}} \\). Within one period, \\( \\sin(5x) \\) takes each value in \\([-1, 1]\\) exactly twice. Therefore, for each \\( k \\) in the range \\(-7 \\leq k \\leq 7\\), there are \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\) solutions to \\( \\sin(5x) = \\frac{k}{7} \\).\n\nSince there are 15 possible values for \\( k \\) (from \\(-7\\) to \\(7\\)), there are:\n\\[\nn = 15 \\times 4 = 60.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine when the graph is tangent to the \\( x \\)-axis\n\nThe graph of \\( y = f(x) \\) is tangent to the \\( x \\)-axis when \\( f(x) = 0 \\) and the derivative \\( f'(x) \\neq 0 \\).\n\nThe derivative of \\( f(x) \\) is:\n\\[\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\sin(7\\pi \\cdot \\sin(5x))) \\right).\n\\]\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\n\\[\nf'(x) = 7\\pi \\cdot \\cos(7\\pi \\cdot \\sin(5x))) \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\sin(5x)) \\right).\n\\]\nSimplifying further, we have:\n\\[\nf'(x) = 7\\pi \\cdot \\cos(7\\pi \\cdot \\sin(5x))) \\cdot 5 \\cos(5x).\n\\]\nFor \\( f'(x) \\neq 0 \\), we need:\n\\[\n7\\pi \\cdot \\cos(7\\pi \\cdot \\sin(5x))) \\cdot 5 \\cos(5x) \\neq 0.\n\\]\nThis implies that \\( \\cos(7\\pi \\cdot \\sin(5x))) \\neq 0 \\) and \\( \\cos(5x) \\neq 0 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of solutions \\( t \\)\n\nFor each \\( k \\) in the range \\(-7 \\leq k \\leq 7\\), we need to count the number of solutions to:\n\\[\n\\cos(5x) = \\frac{1}{5} \\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{k}{7} \\right)^2} }.\n\\]\nThis equation has solutions when \\( \\cos(5x) \\neq 0 \\). Since \\( \\cos(5x) \\) has a period of \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{5}} \\), there are \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\) solutions to \\( \\cos(5x) = \\frac{1}{5} \\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{k}{7} \\right)^2} } \\).\n\nSince there are 15 possible values for \\( k \\) (from \\(-7\\) to \\(7\\)), there are:\n\\[\nt = 15 \\times 4 = 60.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]",

The numerator is a polynomial of degree 5, with roots at $x = 18, 72, 98, k$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Critical Points\nTo find the critical points of $f(x)$, we need to find the values of $x$ where the derivative $f'(x)$ is zero or undefined. Since $f(x)$ is undefined at $x = 0$, we only need to consider the critical points in the domain of $f(x)$, which is $(0, \\infty)$.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Values of $k$\nTo find the values of $k$ such that $f(x)$ achieves its minimum value at exactly two positive real numbers $x$, we need to analyze the behavior of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches the roots of the numerator.\n\nLet's consider the behavior of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches each of the roots $18, 72, 98, k$.\n\n1. **As $x \\to 18^+$:**\n   \\[ f(x) \\approx \\frac{(x - 18)(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k))}{x} \\approx \\frac{(x - 18)}{x} \\cdot (x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k)) \\]\n   As $x \\to 18^+$, the term $\\frac{(x - 18)}{x}}$ approaches 0, and the term $(x - 72)(x - 98)(x - k))$ approaches a non-zero value. Therefore, $f(x)$ approaches 0 as $x \\to 18^+$.\n\n2. **As $x \\to 72^+$:**\n   Similarly, as $x \\to 72^+$, $f(x)$ approaches 0.\n\n3. **As $x \\to 98^+$:**\n   Similarly, as $x \\to 98^+$, $f(x)$ approaches 0.\n\n4. **As $x \\to k^+$:**\n   Similarly, as $x \\to k^+$, $f(x)$ approaches 0.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Values of $k$\nTo ensure that $f(x)$ achieves its minimum value at exactly two positive real numbers $x$, we need to choose the values of $k$ such that the function $f(x)$ has exactly two local minima.\n\nBy analyzing the behavior of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches each of the roots, we can determine that the values of $k$ that satisfy the given conditions are $k = 18, 72, 98$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Sum of the Values of $k$\nThe sum of the values of $k$ is:\n\\[ 18 + 72 + 98 = 188 \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{188} \\]",
