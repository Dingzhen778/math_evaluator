      "generated_solution": "In the first cycle, Anna saves 5 dollars in Week 1, 6 dollars in Week 2, and so on, until she saves 20 dollars in Week 6. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1 dollar.\nThe sum of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula: S = (n/2)(a + l), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term.\nIn this case, the first term is 5, the last term is 20, and the common difference is 1. We want to find the sum of the first 6 terms, so n = 6.\nPlugging in the values, we have S = (6/2)(5 + 20) = 3(25) = 75.\nIn the second cycle, Anna saves 5 dollars in Week 17, 6 dollars in Week 18, and so on, until she saves 20 dollars in Week 32. This is another arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1 dollar.\nUsing the same formula, we can find the sum of the second cycle: S = (16/2)(5 + 20) = 8(25) = 200.\nSince the pattern repeats every 16 weeks, we can find the sum of the remaining cycles by dividing the total number of weeks (52) by the number of weeks in a cycle (16) and subtracting the sum of the first two cycles.\nThe sum of the remaining cycles is (52/16)(75 + 200) = 3(275) = 825.\nTherefore, the total amount of money Anna will save in 1 full year is 75 + 200 + 825 = 1100.\nThe answer is: 1100",
