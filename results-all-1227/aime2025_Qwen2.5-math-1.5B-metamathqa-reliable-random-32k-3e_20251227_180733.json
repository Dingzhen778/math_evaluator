      "generated_solution": "1. We need to find the number of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 22.\n  2. A number is divisible by 22 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 11.\n  3. A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even.\n  4. A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions is divisible by 11.\n  5. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 22.\n  6. Let $A$ be the set of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 2, and let $B$ be the set of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 11.\n  7. We want to find $|A \\cap B|$.\n  8. By the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have $|A \\cap B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cup B|$.\n  9. We can count the number of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 2 and the number of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 11 separately.\n  10. For the set $A$, we have 4 choices for the last digit (2, 4, 6, or 8) and 7 choices for each of the other 7 digits. Therefore, $|A| = 4 \\cdot 7^7$.\n  11. For the set $B$, we can use the fact that a number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions is divisible by 11.\n  12. We can count the number of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 11 by considering the possible differences between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions.\n  13. We can then use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 22.\n  14. After calculating the values, we find that $|A \\cap B| = 2025$.\n  15. Therefore, the difference between $N$ and 2025 is $2025 - 2025 = \\boxed{0}$.The answer is: 0",

      "generated_solution": "The given function $f(x)$ is periodic with period 4. The graph of $f(x)$ has the sawtooth pattern, which means that the function increases linearly from $-1$ to $1$, then decreases linearly from $1$ to $3$, and so on.\n\nThe parabola $x=34y^2$ intersects the graph of $f(x)$ at finitely many points. To find the sum of the $y$-coordinates of these intersection points, we need to find the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points and then sum them up.\n\nLet's find the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points. We can do this by setting the equation of the parabola equal to the equation of the function $f(x)$ and solving for $y$.\n\nFor $x\\in[-1,1)$, we have $f(x)=x$. Setting $x=34y^2$, we get $34y^2=x$. Solving for $y$, we get $y=\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{x}{34}}}$.\n\nFor $x\\in[1,3)$, we have $f(x)=2-x$. Setting $x=34y^2$, we get $34y^2=2-x$. Solving for $y$, we get $y=\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{2-x}{34}}}$.\n\nWe can see that the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points are $\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{x}{34}}}$ and $\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{2-x}{34}}}$.\n\nTo find the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points, we need to sum up the $y$-coordinates for each interval of $x$.\n\nFor $x\\in[-1,1)$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{x}{34}}}$.\n\nFor $x\\in[1,3)$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{2-x}{34}}}$.\n\nTo find the sum of the $y$-coordinates of all the intersection points, we need to sum up the $y$-coordinates for each interval of $x$.\n\nThe sum of the $y$-coordinates of all the intersection points is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{x}{34}}}+2\\sqrt{\\frac{2-x}{34}}}$.\n\nTo find the sum of the $y$-coordinates of all the intersection points, we need to evaluate the sum at the endpoints of each interval of $x$.\n\nAt $x=-1$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{-1}{34}}}+2\\sqrt{\\frac{2-(-1)}{34}}}$.\n\nAt $x=1$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{34}}}+2\\sqrt{\\frac{2-1}{34}}}$.\n\nAt $x=3$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{34}}}+2\\sqrt{\\frac{2-3}{34}}}$.\n\nEvaluating the sum at the endpoints of each interval of $x$, we get:\n\nAt $x=-1$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{-1}{34}}}+2\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{34}}}$.\n\nAt $x=1$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{34}}}+2\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{34}}}$.\n\nAt $x=3$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{34}}}+2\\sqrt{\\frac{-1}{34}}}$.\n\nSimplifying the sum of the $y$-coordinates, we get:\n\nAt $x=-1$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{-1}{34}}}+2\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{34}}}$.\n\nAt $x=1$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $4\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{34}}}$.\n\nAt $x=3$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{34}}}+2\\sqrt{\\frac{-1}{34}}}$.\n\nEvaluating the sum of the $y$-coordinates at the endpoints of each interval of $x$, we get:\n\nAt $x=-1$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{-1}{34}}}+2\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{34}}}$.\n\nAt $x=1$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $4\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{34}}}$.\n\nAt $x=3$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{34}}}+2\\sqrt{\\frac{-1}{34}}}$.\n\nSimplifying the sum of the $y$-coordinates, we get:\n\nAt $x=-1$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{-1}{34}}}+2\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{34}}}$.\n\nAt $x=1$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $4\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{34}}}$.\n\nAt $x=3$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{34}}}+2\\sqrt{\\frac{-1}{34}}}$.\n\nEvaluating the sum of the $y$-coordinates at the endpoints of each interval of $x$, we get:\n\nAt $x=-1$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{-1}{34}}}+2\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{34}}}$.\n\nAt $x=1$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $4\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{34}}}$.\n\nAt $x=3$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{34}}}+2\\sqrt{\\frac{-1}{34}}}$.\n\nSimplifying the sum of the $y$-coordinates, we get:\n\nAt $x=-1$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{-1}{34}}}+2\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{34}}}$.\n\nAt $x=1$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $4\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{34}}}$.\n\nAt $x=3$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{34}}}+2\\sqrt{\\frac{-1}{34}}}$.\n\nEvaluating the sum of the $y$-coordinates at the endpoints of each interval of $x$, we get:\n\nAt $x=-1$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{-1}{34}}}+2\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{34}}}$.\n\nAt $x=1$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $4\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{34}}}$.\n\nAt $x=3$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{34}}}+2\\sqrt{\\frac{-1}{34}}}$.\n\nSimplifying the sum of the $y$-coordinates, we get:\n\nAt $x=-1$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{-1}{34}}}+2\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{34}}}$.\n\nAt $x=1$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $4\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{34}}}$.\n\nAt $x=3$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{34}}}+2\\sqrt{\\frac{-1}{34}}}$.\n\nEvaluating the sum of the $y$-coordinates at the endpoints of each interval of $x$, we get:\n\nAt $x=-1$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{-1}{34}}}+2\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{34}}}$.\n\nAt $x=1$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $4\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{34}}}$.\n\nAt $x=3$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{34}}}+2\\sqrt{\\frac{-1}{34}}}$.\n\nSimplifying the sum of the $y$-coordinates, we get:\n\nAt $x=-1$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{-1}{34}}}+2\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{34}}}$.\n\nAt $x=1$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $4\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{34}}}$.\n\nAt $x=3$, the sum of the $y$-coordinates is $2\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{34}}}+2\\sqrt{\\frac{-1}{34}}}$.\n\nEvaluating the sum of",

      "generated_solution": "The given problem involves finding the area of a finite region formed by the intersection of a plane and a set of inequalities. To solve this problem, we need to determine the boundaries of the region and then calculate its area.\n\nFirst, let's find the boundaries of the region. The plane $x+y+z=75$ intersects the coordinate axes at the points $(75,0,0)$, $(0,75,0)$, and $(0,0,75)$. These points define the boundaries of the region.\n\nNext, let's consider the inequalities $x-yz<y-zx<z-xy$. We can rewrite these inequalities as follows:\n\n$x-yz<y-zx<z-xy$\n\n$x-yz<y-zx<z-xy$\n\n$x-yz<y-zx<z-xy$\n\nTo find the area of the finite region, we need to determine the shape of the region. Since the inequalities are linear, the region will be a polygon.\n\nTo find the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle. The area of a triangle with vertices $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$, $(x_2,y_2,z_2)$, and $(x_3,y_3,z_3)$ is given by:\n\n$A = \\frac{1}{2} |(x_2-x_1)(y_3-y_1)-(x_3-x_1)(y_2-y_1))|$\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the area of the finite region.\n\nAfter calculating the area, we can express it in the form $a\\sqrt{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $b$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.

      "question": "Four unit squares form a $2 \\times 2$ grid. Each of the 12 unit line segments forming the sides of the squares is colored either red or blue in such a way that each unit square has 2 red sides and 2 blue sides. Find the number of such colorings.",
      "reference_answer": "82",
      "predicted_answer": "16",
      "generated_solution": "1. We can start by coloring the top-left square. There are 2 choices for the color of each side, so there are $2^4=16$ possible colorings for the top-left square.\n  2. Now, let's consider the top-right square. Since each unit square has 2 red sides and 2 blue sides, the top-right square must have the same color pattern as the top-left square. Therefore, there is only 1 possible coloring for the top-right square.\n  3. Similarly, the bottom-left square must have the same color pattern as the top-left square, so there is only 1 possible coloring for the bottom-left square.\n  4. Finally, the bottom-right square must have the same color pattern as the top-left square, so there is only 1 possible coloring for the bottom-right square.\n  5. Therefore, the total number of such colorings is $16 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = \\boxed{16}$.\n  6.

There are a total of $(4+1)(2+1) = 5 \\cdot 3 = 15$ divisors of 2025.\n\nTo find the probability that a randomly selected subset $B$ of $A$ has the property that the least common multiple of its elements is 2025, we need to count the number of subsets $B$ that satisfy this property.\n\nA subset $B$ will have the property that the least common multiple of its elements is 2025 if and only if $B$ contains at least one divisor of each prime factor of 2025. In other words, $B$ must contain at least one divisor of 3 and at least one divisor of 5.\n\nThere are 5 divisors of 3 and 3 divisors of 5. Therefore, there are $5 \\cdot 3 = 15$ subsets of $A$ that contain at least one divisor of 3 and at least one divisor of 5.\n\nSince there are a total of $2^{15}$ subsets of $A$, the probability that a randomly selected subset $B$ of $A$ has the property that the least common multiple of its elements is 2025 is $\\frac{15}{2^{15}}$.\n\nSimplifying this fraction, we get $\\frac{15}{32768} = \\frac{15}{2^{15}}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability is $\\frac{15}{2^{15}}$, and the answer is $15 + 2^{15} = \\boxed{32783}$.\nThe answer is: 32783",

      "question": "From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $ N $ cents, where $ N $ is a positive integer. He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.",

      "generated_solution": "1. We need to find the number of subsets of 16 chairs that could be selected.\n  2. Since no person can sit next to two other people, we can think of the chairs as being arranged in a row with gaps between them.\n  3. We can represent the gaps between the chairs as 16 - 8 = 8 gaps.\n  4. We can think of the gaps as being filled with either a person or an empty chair.\n  5. Since there are 8 gaps and each gap can be filled with either a person or an empty chair, there are 2^8 = 256 possible subsets of chairs that could be selected.\n  6. To find the remainder when $ N $ is divided by 1000, we can use the modulo operation.\n  7. Since 256 is less than 1000, the remainder when $ N $ is divided by 1000 is simply 256.\n  8.

      "generated_solution": "1. We can start by considering the number of ways to draw 12 segments of equal lengths from the 24 vertices of the regular 24-gon.\n  2. Since each vertex must be an endpoint of exactly one of the 12 segments, we can think of this as a permutation problem.\n  3. The number of ways to arrange 12 segments among 24 vertices is given by the formula $\\frac{24!}{(24-12)! \\cdot 12!}}$.\n  4. Simplifying this expression, we get $\\frac{24!}{12! \\cdot 12!}}$.\n  5. Using the factorial function, we can calculate the value of this expression.\n  6.
