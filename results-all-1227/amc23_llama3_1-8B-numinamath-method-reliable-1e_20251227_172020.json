Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   a + b = 45\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the time taken by Alicia and Beth to meet:**\n   Let $t$ be the time in hours it takes for them to meet. Alicia bikes at 18 mph, so she covers $18t$ miles. Beth bikes at 12 mph, so she covers $12t$ miles.\n\n4. **Set up the equation for time:**\n   Since they meet at the same time, the distances covered by both will be equal:\n   \\[\n   18t = 12t + 45\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for $t$:**\n   Subtract $12t$ from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   18t - 12t = 45\n   \\]\n   Simplify:\n   \\[\n   6t = 45\n   \\]\n   Divide both sides by 6:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{45}{6} = 7.5\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the distances $a$ and $b$:**\n   Now that we have the time $t$, we can find the distances $a$ and $b$:\n   \\[\n   a = 18t = 18 \\times 7.5 = 135\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   b = 12t = 12 \\times 7.5 = 90\n   \\]\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   Therefore, when Alicia and Beth meet, Alicia will be 135 miles from City $A$, and Beth will be 90 miles from City $B$.

      "generated_solution": "Let $A(x_1, y_1)$ and $B(x_2, y_2)$ be the points on the graph of $y=\\log_{2}x$. The midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ is given as $(6, 2)$. Therefore, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = 6 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} = 2\n\\]\nFrom the second equation, we have $y_1 + y_2 = 4$. Since $y_1 = \\log_{2}x_1$ and $y_2 = \\log_{2}x_2$, we can write:\n\\[\n\\log_{2}x_1 + \\log_{2}x_2 = 4\n\\]\nUsing the property of logarithms, we can combine the logs:\n\\[\n\\log_{2}(x_1x_2) = 4\n\\]\nThis implies $x_1x_2 = 2^4 = 16$. Since $x_1$ and $x_2$ are positive, we can write $x_1 = 2^a$ and $x_2 = 2^b$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers. Thus, $2^a \\cdot 2^b = 16$, which gives $2^{a+b} = 16$. Since $16 = 2^4$, we have $a+b = 4$.\n\nThe positive difference between the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ is $x_2 - x_1 = 2^b - 2^a$. Since $a$ and $b$ are integers, $2^a$ and $2^b$ are powers of 2. The difference $2^b - 2^a$ can be expressed as $2^a(2^{b-a} - 1)$. Since $a+b = 4$, we have $b-a = 4 - a$. Therefore, $2^{b-a} - 1 = 2^{4-a} - 1$.\n\nThe positive difference between the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ is $2^a(2^{4-a} - 1)$.

When the roots of this polynomial are removed from the number line, the remaining points form 11 disjoint open intervals. We need to determine how many of these intervals \\( P(x) \\) is positive.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Polynomial:**\n   The polynomial \\( P(x) \\) is a product of linear factors, each raised to a power. The roots of \\( P(x) \\) are \\( 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10 \\), and each root is raised to a power equal to its position in the sequence.\n\n3. **Counting the Intervals:**\n   When the roots are removed, the number line is divided into 11 intervals. These intervals are \\( (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), \\ldots, (10, 11) \\).\n\n4. **Determining Where \\( P(x) \\) is Positive:**\n   For \\( P(x) \\) to be positive, \\( x \\) must be in the intervals where the polynomial does not change sign.
