      "generated_solution": "Let $r$ be the number of red numbers in the set $S$ and $b$ be the number of blue numbers in the set $S$.\nSince $r + b = n$, we have $r = n - b$.\nThe number of ordered triples $(x, y, z)$ such that $x, y, z$ are of the same color is $r^3 + b^3$.\nThe number of ordered triples $(x, y, z)$ such that $x+y+z$ is divisible by $n$ is $\\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$.\nWe are given that $r^3 + b^3 = \\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$.\nSubstituting $r = n -

This means that $|x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_i|$ is the maximum value among the remaining $n-i+1$ numbers.\n\nTherefore, the price $G$ is equal to the maximum value among the $n$ numbers.\n\nNow, let's consider the price $D$. The price $D$ is the maximum value among the sums $x_1, x_1 + x_2, x_1 + x_2 + x_3, \\ldots, x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_n$.\n\nSince the maximum value among the $n$ numbers is the same as the maximum value among the sums, we have $G = D$.\n\nTherefore, the inequality $G \\leqslant cD$ becomes $D \\leqslant cD$.\n\nSince $D$ is a positive number, we can divide both sides of the inequality by $D$ to get $1 \\leqslant c$.\n\nTherefore, the least possible constant $c$ is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nThe answer is: 1",

Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise.

      "question": "Elizabeth is in an \"escape room\" puzzle. She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle. The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to \"flip\" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$. For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute). Define $E(n, k)=\\infty$ if the puzzle is impossible to solve (that is, if it is impossible to have all switches on at the end of any minute).\n\nFor convenience, assume the $n$ light switches are numbered 1 through $n$.\nFind the following in terms of $n$. $E(n, 2)$ for positive even integers $n$",
