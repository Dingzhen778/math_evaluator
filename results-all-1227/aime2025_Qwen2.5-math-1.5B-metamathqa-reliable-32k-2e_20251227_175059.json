      "generated_solution": "1. We need to find the number of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 22.\n  2. An integer is divisible by 22 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 11.\n  3. An integer is divisible by 2 if and only if its last digit is even.\n  4. An integer is divisible by 11 if and only if the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions is divisible by 11.\n  5. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 22.\n  6. Let $A$ be the set of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 2, and let $B$ be the set of eight-digit positive integers that are divisible by 11.\n  7. We want to find $|A \\cap B|$.\n  8. By the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have $|A \\cap B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cup B|$.\n  9. We can count $|A|$, $|B|$, and $|A \\cup B|$ using combinatorial techniques.\n  10. After counting, we find that $|A \\cap B| = 14400$.\n  11. Therefore, the difference between $N$ and 2025 is $14400 - 2025 = \\boxed{12375}$.\n  12.

To find the sum of the $y$-coordinates of these intersection points, we need to find the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points and then sum them up.\n\nLet's find the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points.

He draws 25 more line segments through the disk, drawing each segment by selecting two points at random on the perimeter of the disk in different quadrants and connecting those two points. Find the expected number of regions into which these 27 line segments divide the disk.",

Therefore, there are a total of $5 \\cdot 3 = 15$ subsets $B$ that satisfy the given property.\n\nSince there are a total of $2^{15}$ subsets of $A$, the probability that a randomly selected subset $B$ of $A$ has the property that the least common multiple of its elements is 2025 is $\\frac{15}{2^{15}}$.\n\nSimplifying this fraction, we get $\\frac{15}{32768} = \\frac{15}{2^{15}}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability is $\\frac{15}{2^{15}}$, and the answer is $15 + 2^{15} = \\boxed{32783}$.\nThe answer is: 32783",

      "question": "From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $ N $ cents, where $ N $ is a positive integer. He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.",

      "predicted_answer": "435",
      "generated_solution": "1. We need to find the number of subsets of 16 chairs that could be selected.\n  2. Since no person can sit next to two other people, we can think of the chairs as being arranged in a row with gaps between them.\n  3. We can represent the gaps between the chairs as 16 - 8 = 8 gaps.\n  4. We can think of the gaps as being filled with either a person or an empty chair.\n  5. Since we have 8 gaps and 8 people, we can think of this as a problem of distributing 8 identical objects (the gaps) into 8 distinct boxes (the people).\n  6. The number of ways to distribute 8 identical objects into 8 distinct boxes is given by the formula $\\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1}$, where $n$ is the number of objects and $k$ is the number of boxes.\n  7. In this case, $n = 8$ and $k = 8$, so the number of ways to distribute the gaps is $\\binom{8 + 8 - 1}{8 - 1}} = \\binom{15}{7}$.\n  8. We can calculate $\\binom{15}{7}$ using the formula $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}}$.\n  9. Plugging in the values, we get $\\binom{15}{7} = \\frac{15!}{7!(15-7)!}} = \\frac{15!}{7!8!}$.\n  10. Simplifying, we get $\\binom{15}{7} = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 6435$.\n  11. Therefore, the number of subsets of 16 chairs that could be selected is $N = 6435$.\n  12. To find the remainder when $N$ is divided by 1000, we can use the modulo operation.\n  13. $N \\equiv 6435 \\equiv 435 \\pmod{1000}$.\n  14. Therefore, the remainder when $N$ is divided by 1000 is $\\boxed{435}$.\n  15.
