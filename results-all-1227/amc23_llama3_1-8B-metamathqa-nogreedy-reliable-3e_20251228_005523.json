      "generated_solution": "Let $x$ be the number of hours it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet. Since Alicia bikes at 18 miles per hour and Beth bikes at 12 miles per hour, the distance they will have traveled is $18x$ and $12x$ miles, respectively. Since the distance between the two cities is 45 miles, we have the equation $18x + 12x = 45$. Simplifying, we get $30x = 45$, so $x = \\frac{45}{30} = \\frac{3}{2}$. Therefore, Alicia and Beth will meet $\\frac{3}{2}$ hours after they start biking. Since Alicia bikes at 18 miles per hour, she will have traveled $18 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 27$ miles. Therefore, they will be $\\boxed{27}$ miles from City A when they meet.The answer is: 27",
