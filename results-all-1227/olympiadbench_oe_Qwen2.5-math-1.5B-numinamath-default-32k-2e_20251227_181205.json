This means that any multiplicative partition of 64 must consist of factors that are powers of 2.\n\nNext, we consider the possible partitions of 64 into powers of 2. We can start by considering the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 64, which is $2^6 = 64$. \n\nIf we use $2^6$ as one of the parts in the partition, then the remaining part must be 1, since $64 = 2^6 \\times 1$. \n\nTherefore, one of the multiplicative partitions of 64 is $2^6 \\times 1$. \n\nHowever, we can also consider partitions that consist of more than one part. For example, we can consider the partition $2^5 \\times 2^1$. \n\nIn general, we can consider partitions of 64 into powers of 2, where the exponents of the powers of 2 are non-negative integers that sum to 6. \n\nFor example, we can consider the partition $2^4 \\times 2^2 \\times 2^0$. \n\nIn general, we can consider all possible partitions of 64 into powers of 2, where the exponents of the powers of 2 are non-negative integers that sum to 6. \n\nTherefore, the value of $P(64)$ is the number of such partitions. \n\nTo find this number, we can use the following combinatorial argument. \n\nConsider the set of all non-negative integers that sum to 6. This set is given by $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. \n\nWe can think of each element of this set as representing a power of 2 in a multiplicative partition of 64. \n\nFor example, the element 0 represents the power of 2 $2^0 = 1$. \n\nThe element 1 represents the power of 2 $2^1 = 2$. \n\nThe element 2 represents the power of 2 $2^2 = 4$. \n\nThe element 3 represents the power of 2 $2^3 = 8$. \n\nThe element 4 represents the power of 2 $2^4 = 16$. \n\nThe element 5 represents the power of 2 $2^5 = 32$. \n\nThe element 6 represents the power of 2 $2^6 = 64$. \n\nTherefore, the number of multiplicative partitions of 64 is equal to the number of ways we can choose a subset of the set $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$, where the sum of the elements in the subset is 6. \n\nThis number is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{7}{6}} = 7$. \n\nTherefore, the value of $P(64)$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",

      "generated_solution": "To solve the problem of finding the greatest integer \\( k \\leq 1000 \\) such that \\(\\binom{1000}{k}}\\) is a multiple of 7, we will use properties of binomial coefficients and modular arithmetic.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   We need to find the largest \\( k \\) such that \\(\\binom{1000}{k}}\\) is divisible by 7. This means that the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{1000}{k}}\\) must be divisible by 7.\n\n2. **Using Lucas' Theorem:**\n   Lucas' Theorem provides a way to determine the divisibility of binomial coefficients by a prime number. For a prime \\( p \\), and non-negative integers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) with base \\( p \\) representations \\( m = m_k m_{k-1}} \\cdots m_0 \\) and \\( n = n_k n_{k-1}} \\cdots n_0 \\), Lucas' Theorem states:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{m}{n}} \\equiv \\prod_{i=0}^k \\binom{m_i}{n_i}} \\pmod{p}\n   \\]\n   For our problem, \\( p = 7 \\), \\( m = 1000 \\), and \\( n = k \\).\n\n3. **Finding the Base 7 Representation of 1000:**\n   We need to express 1000 in base 7. We do this by repeatedly dividing by 7 and recording the remainders:\n   \\[\n   1000 \\div 7 = 142 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\quad 6\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   142 \\div 7 = 20 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\quad 2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   20 \\div 7 = 2 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\quad 6\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2 \\div 7 = 0 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\quad 2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the base 7 representation of 1000 is \\( 2626_7 \\).\n\n4. **Applying Lucas' Theorem:**\n   According to Lucas' Theorem, \\(\\binom{1000}{k}}\\) is divisible by 7 if and only if there exists at least one digit \\( i \\) such that \\( k_i > m_i \\).\n\n   For \\( m = 2626_7 \\), the digits are \\( m_3 = 2 \\), \\( m_2 = 6 \\), \\( m_1 = 2 \\), and \\( m_0 = 6 \\).\n\n   We need to find the largest \\( k \\) such that \\( k_i \\leq m_i \\) for all \\( i \\).\n\n5. **Finding the Largest \\( k \\):**\n   The largest \\( k \\) that satisfies the condition is \\( 2625_7 \\). This is because \\( k_3 = 2 \\), \\( k_2 = 6 \\), \\( k_1 = 2 \\), and \\( k_0 = 5 \\) are all less than or equal to the corresponding digits in \\( 2626_7 \\).\n\n6. **Converting \\( 2625_7 \\) to Decimal:**\n   To find the decimal value of \\( 2625_7 \\), we use the formula for base conversion:\n   \\[\n   2625_7 = 2 \\cdot 7^3 + 6 \\cdot 7^2 + 2 \\cdot 7^1 + 5 \\cdot 7^0\n   \\]\n   Calculating each term:\n   \\[\n   2 \\cdot 7^3 = 2 \\cdot 343 = 686\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   6 \\cdot 7^2 = 6 \\cdot 49 = 294\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2 \\cdot 7^1 = 2 \\cdot 7 = 14\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   5 \\cdot 7^0 = 5 \\cdot 1 = 5\n   \\]\n   Adding these values together:\n   \\[\n   686 + 294 + 14 + 5 = 1003\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the greatest integer \\( k \\leq 1000 \\) such that \\(\\binom{1000}{k}}\\) is a multiple of 7 is \\(\\boxed{1003}\\).",

A positive integer is fibbish if each digit, after the leftmost two, is at least the sum of the previous two digits.\n\nLet's start by considering the largest possible digit, which is 9. We need to check if we can form a number using 9s that satisfies the fibbish condition.\n\n1. **Check the first two digits:**\n   - The first two digits can be any combination of digits from 0 to 9. However, to maximize the number, we should start with the largest possible digits.\n\n2. **Check the third digit:**\n   - The third digit must be at least the sum of the first two digits. If we start with 9 as the first digit and 9 as the second digit, the third digit must be at least \\(9 + 9 = 18\\). However, 18 is not a valid digit (it must be between 0 and 9).\n\n3. **Adjust the digits:**\n   - Since using 9 as the first two digits does not work, we need to try smaller digits for the first two digits. Let's try 8 as the first digit and 7 as the second digit. The third digit must be at least \\(8 + 7 = 15\\). Again, 15 is not a valid digit.\n\n4. **Continue adjusting the digits:**\n   - We need to keep adjusting the digits until we find a combination that works.

The goal is to have all 6 light switches on at the end of some number of minutes.\n\n3. **Parity Consideration**: Each minute, Elizabeth flips 2 switches. This means that the number of switches that are on after each minute will always be even. This is because flipping 2 switches does not change the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of switches that are on.\n\n4. **Final State Requirement**: To have all 6 light switches on, the number of switches that are on must be 6, which is an even number. This satisfies the parity condition.\n\n5. **Minimum Number of Minutes**: Since Elizabeth can flip 2 switches each minute, and she needs to flip all 6 switches, the minimum number of minutes required is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6}{2}} = 3\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape is $\\boxed{3}$.",

The function $E(n, k)$ represents the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, given $n$ light switches and $k$ switches to flip each minute.\n\nGiven $n = 6$ and $k = 3$, we need to find the minimum number of minutes required to have all 6 switches on.\n\nLet's analyze the process step by step:\n\n1. **Minute 1**: Elizabeth flips 3 switches. Let's assume she flips switches 1, 2, and 3. The state of the switches after the first minute is:\n   - Switch 1: On\n   - Switch 2: On\n   - Switch 3: On\n   - Switch 4: Off\n   - Switch 5: Off\n   - Switch 6: Off\n\n2. **Minute 2**: Elizabeth flips another 3 switches. Let's assume she flips switches 4, 5, and 6. The state of the switches after the second minute is:\n   - Switch 1: On\n   - Switch 2: On\n   - Switch 3: On\n   - Switch 4: On\n   - Switch 5: On\n   - Switch 6: On\n\nAfter 2 minutes, all 6 switches are on. Therefore, $E(6,3) = 2$.\n\nNow, we need to compute the inefficiency $I(6,3)$:\n\n\\[\nI(6,3) = E(6,3) - \\frac{6}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nI(6,3) = 2 - 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nI(6,3) = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, the inefficiency $I(6,3)$ is $\\boxed{0}$.",
