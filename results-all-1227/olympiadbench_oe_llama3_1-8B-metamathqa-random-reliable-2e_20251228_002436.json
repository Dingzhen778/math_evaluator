We want to find the largest constant $K$ such that $\\sum_{1 \\leq i<j \\leq n} x_i x_j \\geq K$ for all $n$-tuples in $S$.\n\nWe can rewrite the inequality as $\\sum_{1 \\leq i<j \\leq n} x_i x_j \\geq K$ as $\\sum_{1 \\leq i<j \\leq n} x_i x_j - K \\geq 0$.\n\nSince $x_i x_j$ is a quadratic function of $x_i$ and $x_j$, we can rewrite the inequality as $\\sum_{1 \\leq i<j \\leq n} (x_i x_j - K) \\geq 0$.\n\nBy the rearrangement inequality, we know that the sum of a set of numbers is maximized when the largest numbers are paired with the smallest numbers, the second largest numbers are paired with the second smallest numbers, and so on.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of $\\sum_{1 \\leq i<j \\leq n} (x_i x_j - K)$ occurs when $x_1$ is paired with $x_2$, $x_3$ is paired with $x_4$, and so on.\n\nLet's consider the case when $n$ is even. In this case, we can pair $x_1$ with $x_2$, $x_3$ with $x_4$, and so on, until we reach $x_{n-1}$ and $x_n$. The sum of these pairs is $x_1 x_2 + x_3 x_4 + \\cdots + x_{n-1} x_n$.\n\nSince this sum is nonnegative, we have $x_1 x_2 + x_3 x_4 + \\cdots + x_{n-1} x_n \\geq 0$.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when $n$ is odd. In this case, we can pair $x_1$ with $x_2$, $x_3$ with $x_4$, and so on, until we reach $x_{n-1}$ and $x_n$. The sum of these pairs is $x_1 x_2 + x_3 x_4 + \\cdots + x_{n-1} x_n$.\n\nSince this sum is nonnegative, we have $x_1 x_2 + x_3 x_4 + \\cdots + x_{n-1} x_n \\geq 0$.\n\nTherefore, in both cases, we have $x_1 x_2 + x_3 x_4 + \\cdots + x_{n-1} x_n \\geq 0$.\n\nSince $x_1 x_2 + x_3 x_4 + \\cdots + x_{n-1} x_n$ is a sum of nonnegative terms, the maximum value of $\\sum_{1 \\leq i<j \\leq n} (x_i x_j - K)$ occurs when $K = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the largest constant $K$ is $\\boxed{0}$.The answer is: 0",

Continuing in that way, he visits houses $n_{3}, n_{4}, \\ldots$, and each time, $d\\left(n_{i}, n_{i+1}\\right)=1 / 3$.

Let's say she flips switches 1, 2, and 3. After the first minute, the switches will be in the state: 1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0.\nIn the second minute, Elizabeth can flip any 3 switches that are currently off.

We can divide the switches into two groups: the switches that Elizabeth flips in the first minute and the switches that she flips in the second minute. Let's call these groups $A$ and $B$, respectively.\n\nIn the first minute, Elizabeth flips $k$ switches from group $A$. This means that there are $n-k$ switches remaining in group $B$.\n\nIn the second minute, Elizabeth flips $k$ switches from group $B$. This means that there are $n-2k$ switches remaining in group $A$.\n\nWe can continue this process until all the switches are flipped.

$\\boxed{10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
