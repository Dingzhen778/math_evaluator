Let's break down the solution into detailed steps.\n\n1. **Identify the Focus of the Ellipse:**\n\n   The given ellipse is $\\Gamma_1: \\frac{x^2}{24} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2}} = 1$ with $0 < b < 2\\sqrt{6}$.\n\n   The foci of the ellipse are located at $(\\pm c, 0)$, where $c = \\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}}$ and $a^2 = 24$.\n\n   Therefore, $c = \\sqrt{24 - b^2}}$.\n\n2. **Identify the Focus of the Parabola:**\n\n   The given parabola is $\\Gamma_2: y^2 = 4px$ with $p \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{+}}$.\n\n   The focus of the parabola is located at $(p, 0)$).\n\n3. **Relate the Foci of the Ellipse and Parabola:**\n\n   According to the problem, the right focus $F_1$ of the ellipse coincides with the focus of the parabola.\n\n   Therefore, $p = \\sqrt{24 - b^2}}$.\n\n4. **Determine the Slope of the Line $l$:**\n\n   The line $l$ passes through the point $F_1$ with a positive integer slope.\n\n   Let the slope of the line $l$ be $m$. Since the slope is a positive integer, we can write $m = k$ for some positive integer $k$.\n\n5. **Find the Points of Intersection:**\n\n   The line $l$ intersects the ellipse $\\Gamma_1$ at points $A$ and $B$, and the parabola $\\Gamma_2$ at points $C$ and $D$.\n\n   To find the points of intersection, we need to solve the system of equations formed by the line $l$ and the ellipse $\\Gamma_1$.\n\n   Similarly, we need to solve the system of equations formed by the line $l$ and the parabola $\\Gamma_2$.\n\n6. **Calculate the Lengths of the Chords:**\n\n   The length of the chord $AB$ of the ellipse can be calculated using the formula for the length of a chord of an ellipse.\n\n   Similarly, the length of the chord $CD$ of the parabola can be calculated using the formula for the length of a chord of a parabola.\n\n7. **Use the Given Condition to Find the Values of $b$ and $p$:**\n\n   According to the problem, $13|AB| = \\sqrt{6}|CD|$.\n\n   Using the formulas for the lengths of the chords, we can set up an equation involving $b$ and $p$.\n\n   Solving this equation, we find that $b^2 + p = 13$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{13}$.",

      "generated_solution": "Given the problem, we start by analyzing the given vector equation:\n\n\\[ 3\\overrightarrow{IA} + 4\\overrightarrow{IB} + 5\\overrightarrow{IC} = \\overrightarrow{0} \\]\n\nWe know that the incenter \\( I \\) of a triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect. The vector \\( \\overrightarrow{IA} \\) represents the vector from the incenter \\( I \\) to vertex \\( A \\).\n\nTo proceed, we use the fact that the incenter \\( I \\) is equidistant from the sides of the triangle. This property allows us to express the vectors \\( \\overrightarrow{IA} \\), \\( \\overrightarrow{IB} \\), and \\( \\overrightarrow{IC} \\) in terms of the sides of the triangle.\n\nLet \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) be the lengths of the sides opposite to vertices \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) respectively. The incenter \\( I \\) divides the angle bisectors in a specific ratio, which can be used to express the vectors \\( \\overrightarrow{IA} \\), \\( \\overrightarrow{IB} \\), and \\( \\overrightarrow{IC} \\) in terms of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nUsing these expressions, we can rewrite the given vector equation in terms of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).

The Law of Cosines states that:\n\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos C \\]\n\nBy substituting the relationship between \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) obtained from the vector equation into the Law of Cosines, we can solve for \\( \\cos C \\).\n\nFinally, we use the inverse cosine function to find the measure of angle \\( C \\).\n\nAfter performing these steps, we find that the measure of angle \\( C \\) is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90^\\circ} \\]",

      "generated_solution": "To solve the given problem, we need to find the value of $\\sin A$ when the product of the three altitudes of triangle $ABC$ is maximized, given that the area of the triangle is 1 and $BC = 1$.\n\nLet's denote the altitudes from vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$ to the opposite sides as $h_A$, $h_B$, and $h_C$, respectively.\n\nThe area of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed in terms of its altitudes and the corresponding sides. Specifically, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of } \\triangle ABC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times BC \\times h_A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times h_A = \\frac{1}{2} h_A\n\\]\n\nGiven that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is 1, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} h_A = 1\n\\]\n\nSolving for $h_A$, we get:\n\n\\[\nh_A = 2\n\\]\n\nNow, let's consider the product of the three altitudes, $h_A \\cdot h_B \\cdot h_C$. We want to maximize this product.\n\nUsing the formula for the area of a triangle in terms of its altitudes and the corresponding sides, we can express the product of the altitudes as:\n\n\\[\nh_A \\cdot h_B \\cdot h_C = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{Area of } \\triangle ABC}{BC}} \\cdot \\frac{2 \\times \\text{Area of } \\triangle ABC}{AC}} \\cdot \\frac{2 \\times \\text{Area of } \\triangle ABC}{AB}}\n\\]\n\nGiven that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is 1 and $BC = 1$, we can simplify the expression for the product of the altitudes:\n\n\\[\nh_A \\cdot h_B \\cdot h_C = \\frac{2 \\times 1}{1}} \\cdot \\frac{2 \\times 1}{AC}} \\cdot \\frac{2 \\times 1}{AB}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nh_A \\cdot h_B \\cdot h_C = 2 \\cdot \\frac{2}{AC}} \\cdot \\frac{2}{AB}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nh_A \\cdot h_B \\cdot h_C = \\frac{8}{AC \\cdot AB}}\n\\]\n\nTo maximize the product of the altitudes, we need to minimize the denominator $AC \\cdot AB$. This occurs when $AC = AB$, which implies that $\\triangle ABC$ is an isosceles triangle with $AC = AB$.\n\nIn an isosceles triangle, the altitude from the vertex angle to the base bisects the base and the vertex angle. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\nh_A = \\frac{1}{2} BC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nHowever, we previously found that $h_A = 2$. This discrepancy arises because we assumed that $AC = AB$ without considering the given condition that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is 1.\n\nTo reconcile this, we need to consider the relationship between the sides and the area of the triangle. Specifically, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of } \\triangle ABC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times BC \\times h_A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times h_A = \\frac{1}{2} h_A\n\\]\n\nGiven that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is 1, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} h_A = 1\n\\]\n\nSolving for $h_A$, we get:\n\n\\[\nh_A = 2\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that the altitude $h_A$ is indeed 2, as we previously found.\n\nNow, let's consider the relationship between the sides and the area of the triangle.

If each face is not an isosceles triangle, then each face must be a scalene triangle.

A. Kapaev titled \"On the asymptotic behavior of solutions of the Painlevé first equation in the complex domain\"? The main focus of the research paper by A. A. Kapaev is to investigate the asymptotic behavior of solutions of the Painlevé first equation in the complex domain. The Painlevé first equation is a second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation that is part of a family of six equations known as the Painlevé equations. These equations are important in the field of mathematical physics and have applications in various areas such as quantum field theory, statistical mechanics, and nonlinear optics.\n\nIn the paper, Kapaev uses the method of isomonodromic deformations to study the asymptotic behavior of the solutions. The method of isomonodromic deformations is a powerful tool in the theory of differential equations, particularly for studying the behavior of solutions near singular points. By applying this method, Kapaev is able to derive asymptotic expansions for the solutions of the Painlevé first equation as the independent variable approaches infinity in the complex plane.\n\nThe paper contributes to the understanding of the Painlevé first equation by providing detailed asymptotic analysis and by establishing the existence of certain asymptotic expansions.

The reciprocal sum of these step lengths is given by:\n\n$$T = \\frac{1}{a_1}} + \\frac{1}{a_2}} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{a_{2^{n}-1}}}}$$\n\nTo minimize $T$, we need to choose the step lengths $a_i$ such that their reciprocals are as small as possible. This can be achieved by choosing the step lengths to be powers of 2, i.e., $a_i = 2^k$ for some integer $k$.\n\nNow, let's consider the set of points that the frog can jump to. This set is given by:\n\n$$S = \\\\left\\\\{1, 2, 3, \\\\cdots, 2^{n}-1}\\\\right\\\\}$$\n\nSince the frog can jump to each point in $S$ exactly once, we can assume that the frog jumps to the points in $S$ in some order.\n\nNow, let's consider the step lengths that the frog can choose.

Since the frog can choose the step lengths in some order, we can assume that the reciprocal sum of the step lengths is minimized when the step lengths are chosen in increasing order of their reciprocals.\n\nTherefore, to minimize $T$, we need to choose the step lengths to be powers of 2 in increasing order of their reciprocals.

The key insight is that the quotient of the LCM and GCD of any two numbers is always equal to the product of those two numbers.\n\nLet's denote the two numbers as \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The LCM of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is denoted as \\(\\text{lcm}(a, b)}\\), and the GCD of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is denoted as \\(\\text{gcd}(a, b)}\\).\n\nThe relationship between the LCM and GCD of two numbers is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{lcm}(a, b)} \\times \\text{gcd}(a, b)} = a \\times b\n\\]\n\nWe are asked to find the maximum number of numbers that can be selected from 1 to 100 such that the quotient of the LCM and GCD of any two numbers is not a perfect square.\n\nLet's denote the set of selected numbers as \\(S\\). We need to ensure that for any two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in \\(S\\), the quotient \\(\\frac{\\text{lcm}(a, b)}{\\text{gcd}(a, b)}}\\) is not a perfect square.\n\nTo achieve this, we need to select numbers such that their pairwise products are not perfect squares. This means that we cannot select two numbers whose product is a perfect square.\n\nLet's consider the prime factorization of the numbers from 1 to 100. A number is a perfect square if and only if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even.\n\nTo ensure that the product of any two selected numbers is not a perfect square, we need to select numbers such that their prime factorizations do not have all even exponents.\n\nOne way to achieve this is to select numbers that are products of distinct prime numbers. This ensures that the product of any two selected numbers will have at least one prime factor with an odd exponent, making it not a perfect square.\n\nLet's count the number of such numbers from 1 to 100. We need to consider the prime numbers less than or equal to 100. The prime numbers less than or equal to 100 are:\n\n2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97\n\nThere are 25 prime numbers less than or equal to 100.\n\nTo form a number that is a product of distinct prime numbers, we can choose any subset of these 25 prime numbers. The number of subsets of a set with \\(n\\) elements is \\(2^n\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of subsets of the set of 25 prime numbers is \\(2^{25}\\).\n\nHowever, we need to exclude the empty subset, as it does not correspond to a valid number in the range from 1 to 100.\n\nThus, the number of valid subsets is \\(2^{25} - 1}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(2^{25} - 1}\\) gives us the maximum number of numbers that can be selected from 1 to 100 to ensure that the quotient of the LCM and GCD of any two numbers is not a perfect square.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{33554431}\n\\]",

The mapping $\\psi$ satisfies two properties:\n1. $\\psi(AB) = \\psi(BA)$ for any $A, B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 3}$.\n2. $\\psi(A) = \\text{tr}(A)$ for any diagonal matrix $A$.\n\nGiven the matrix $A$:\n\\[\nA = \\left(\n      \\begin{array}{ccc}\n        1 & 2 & 2 \\\\\\\\\n        2 & 1 & 2 \\\\\\\\\n        2 & 2 & 1 \\\\\\\\\n      \\\\end{array}\n    \\right),\n\\]\nwe need to find $\\psi(A)$.\n\nFirst, let's consider the property $\\psi(AB) = \\psi(BA)$. This property suggests that $\\psi$ is invariant under cyclic permutations of matrix products.\n\nNext, we use the second property $\\psi(A) = \\text{tr}(A)$ for any diagonal matrix $A$. This property tells us that $\\psi$ applied to a diagonal matrix is simply the sum of its diagonal elements.\n\nTo find $\\psi(A)$, we can use the fact that $\\psi$ is invariant under cyclic permutations. We can express $A$ in a form that allows us to use this property.\n\nConsider the matrix $A$ and its transpose $A^T$:\n\\[\nA^T = \\left(\n      \\begin{array}{ccc}\n        1 & 2 & 2 \\\\\\\\\n        2 & 1 & 2 \\\\\\\\\n        2 & 2 & 1 \\\\\\\\\n      \\\\end{array}\n    \\right).\n\\]\nNotice that $A^T = A$. Therefore, $A$ is a symmetric matrix.\n\nFor a symmetric matrix, the trace is the sum of its diagonal elements. Since $A$ is symmetric, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{tr}(A) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n\\]\n\nThus, by the second property of $\\psi$, we have:\n\\[\n\\psi(A) = \\text{tr}(A) = 3.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]",

The chain rule states that:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\eta}(x, \\eta)} = \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}(x, \\eta) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\eta}(x, \\eta)} + \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\eta}(x, \\eta)}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Analyzing the Partial Derivatives:**\n   - The term $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}(x, \\eta)}$ represents the partial derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$.\n   - The term $\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\eta}(x, \\eta)}$ represents the partial derivative of $x$ with respect to $\\eta$.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   Since the initial data $y(0) = \\eta$ is given, and the problem is well-posed, we can assert that $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\eta}(x, \\eta)}$ is always positive.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Yes, } \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\eta}(x, \\eta)} \\text{ is always positive.}}\n\\]",

The general solution to the wave equation can be expressed using d'Alembert's formula for wave equations in higher dimensions.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Conditions and Solution Form\nGiven the initial conditions, we can use the method of characteristics or d'Alembert's formula to find the solution $u(t,x,y)$.

The characteristic equations are given by:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dt}{1} = \\frac{dx}{2} = \\frac{du}{0}}\n   \\]\n   From the first two equations, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dx}{dt} = 2 \\implies x = 2t + C_1\n   \\]\n   where $C_1$ is a constant. From the third equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   du = 0 \\implies u = C_2\n   \\]\n   where $C_2$ is a constant.

Substituting $t = 0$ into the general solution, we get:\n   \\[\n   u(0, x) = f(x) = e^{-x}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the function $f$ is given by:\n   \\[\n   f(x) = e^{-x}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Applying the Boundary Condition:**\n\n   The boundary condition is given by $u(t, 0) = A + Bt$ for $t > 0$. Substituting $x = 0$ into the general solution, we get:\n   \\[\n   u(t, 0) = f(-2t) = e^{-(-2t))} = e^{2t}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   A + Bt = e^{2t}\n   \\]\n   To find the values of $A$ and $B$, we compare the coefficients of $t$ on both sides of the equation. On the left side, the coefficient of $t$ is $B$. On the right side, the coefficient of $t$ is $0$ (since $e^{2t}$ is an exponential function and does not have a linear term in $t$). Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   B = 0\n   \\]\n   On the left side, the constant term is $A$. On the right side, the constant term is $1$ (since $e^{2t}$ is an exponential function and does not have a constant term in $t$). Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   A = 1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n\n   The values of $A$ and $B$ such that there is a solution $u(t, x)$ is $C^1$ in $\\{t \\geq 0, x \\leq 0\\}$ to the equation are $A = 1$ and $B = 0$.

      "generated_solution": "1. **Identify the distribution of the force required to break a brick:**\n   The force required to break a brick is normally distributed with mean \\(\\mu = 195\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2 = 16\\). Therefore, the standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma = \\sqrt{16} = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the probability that a single brick breaks under a force of 190:**\n   We need to find \\(P(X \\leq 190)\\), where \\(X\\) is the force required to break a brick. First, we standardize the value 190:\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{190 - 195}{4} = \\frac{-5}{4} = -1.25\n   \\]\n   Using the standard normal distribution table, we find that:\n   \\[\n   P(Z \\leq -1.25) \\approx 0.1056\n   \\]\n   So, the probability that a single brick breaks under a force of 190 is approximately 0.1056.\n\n3. **Model the number of bricks that break under a force of 190:**\n   Let \\(Y\\) be the number of bricks out of 300 that break under a force of 190. Since each brick breaking under a force of 190 is an independent event, \\(Y\\) follows a binomial distribution with parameters \\(n = 300\\) and \\(p = 0.1056\\). That is, \\(Y \\sim \\text{Binomial}(300, 0.1056)\\).\n\n4. **Approximate the binomial distribution with a normal distribution:**\n   Since \\(n\\) is large and \\(p\\) is not too close to 0 or 1, we can approximate the binomial distribution with a normal distribution. The mean \\(\\mu_Y\\) and the standard deviation \\(\\sigma_Y\\) of the normal distribution are:\n   \\[\n   \\mu_Y = np = 300 \\times 0.1056 = 31.68\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_Y = \\sqrt{np(1-p))} = \\sqrt{300 \\times 0.1056 \\times (1 - 0.1056))} = \\sqrt{300 \\times 0.1056 \\times 0.8944} \\approx 5.44\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \\(Y\\) can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean 31.68 and standard deviation 5.44, i.e., \\(Y \\sim \\text{Normal}(31.68, 5.44^2))}\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the probability that at most 30 of the selected bricks break under a force of 190:**\n   We need to find \\(P(Y \\leq 30)\\). Using the normal approximation, we standardize the value 30:\n   \\[\n   Z = \\frac{30 - 31.68}{5.44} = \\frac{-1.68}{5.44} \\approx -0.309\n   \\]\n   Using the standard normal distribution table, we find that:\n   \\[\n   P(Z \\leq -0.309) \\approx 0.3783\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the probability that at most 30 of the selected bricks break under a force of 190 is approximately \\(\\boxed{0.3783}\\).",

      "generated_solution": "Solution:\nLet $p(x)$ be the probability of ever reaching state 0 starting at state $x$. We need to find $p(1)$.\n\nFor $x > 0$, the transition probabilities are:\n- $p(x, x+2) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- $p(x, x-1) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nFor $x = 0$, the transition probabilities are:\n- $p(0, 2) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- $p(0, 0) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nWe can set up the following system of equations based on the transition probabilities:\n\nFor $x = 1$:\n\\[ p(1) = \\frac{1}{2} p(3) + \\frac{1}{2} p(0) \\]\n\nFor $x = 2$:\n\\[ p(2) = \\frac{1}{2} p(4) + \\frac{1}{2} p(1) \\]\n\nFor $x = 3$:\n\\[ p(3) = \\frac{1}{2} p(5) + \\frac{1}{2} p(2) \\]\n\nAnd so on. We can see that the equations for $p(x)$ for $x > 0$ are similar to the equations for $p(x)$ for $x < 0$, but with the roles of $x$ and $-x$ reversed.\n\nTo solve this system of equations, we can use the method of successive approximations or the method of generating functions. However, for this specific problem, we can use a more intuitive approach.\n\nNotice that the transition probabilities from any state $x > 0$ to states $x+2$ and $x-1$ are symmetric. This symmetry suggests that the probability of ever reaching state 0 starting at any state $x > 0$ is the same. Let's denote this probability by $p$.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\\[ p(1) = p(2) = p(3) = \\cdots = p \\]\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes must equal 1. In this case, the possible outcomes are reaching state 0 or not reaching state 0. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ p(1) + (1 - p(1))) = 1 \\]\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\\[ p + (1 - p) = 1 \\]\n\\[ p + 1 - p = 1 \\]\n\\[ 1 = 1 \\]\n\nThis equation is always true, which means that our assumption that $p(1) = p$ is correct. Therefore, the probability of ever reaching state 0 starting at $x=1$ is $\\boxed{p}$.",

Thus, we have:\n   \\[\n   L(\\theta) = \\left( \\frac{2}{\\theta}} \\right)^n \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n X_i \\right) e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 / \\theta}}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Form the likelihood ratio test statistic:**\n\n   The likelihood ratio test statistic is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\lambda = \\frac{\\sup_{\\theta \\le \\theta_0} L(\\theta)}}{\\sup_{\\theta > 0} L(\\theta)}}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs):**\n\n   - For \\(H_0: \\theta \\le \\theta_0\\), the MLE of \\(\\theta\\) is \\(\\hat{\\theta}_0} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2\\).\n   - For \\(H_1: \\theta > \\theta_0\\), the MLE of \\(\\theta\\) is \\(\\hat{\\theta}_1} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2\\).\n\n5. **Construct the likelihood ratio test statistic:**\n\n   Substituting the MLEs into the likelihood ratio test statistic, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\lambda = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{\\hat{\\theta}_0}}} \\right)^n \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n X_i \\right) e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 / \\hat{\\theta}_0}}} \\left( \\frac{2}{\\hat{\\theta}_1}}} \\right)^n \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n X_i \\right) e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 / \\hat{\\theta}_1}}}.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Simplify the likelihood ratio test statistic:**\n\n   Since \\(\\hat{\\theta}_0 = \\hat{\\theta}_1\\), the likelihood ratio test statistic simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\lambda = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{\\hat{\\theta}_0}}} \\right)^n e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 / \\hat{\\theta}_0}}} \\left( \\frac{2}{\\hat{\\theta}_0}}} \\right)^n e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 / \\hat{\\theta}_0}}}.\n   \\]\n\n7. **Determine the critical region:**\n\n   The likelihood ratio test statistic \\(\\lambda\\) is a function of \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2\\). We reject \\(H_0\\) if \\(\\lambda\\) is small, which corresponds to \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2\\) being large.\n\n8. **Find the critical value:**\n\n   Let \\(\\chi_{2n, \\alpha}^2\\) be the value such that \\(P(\\chi_{2n}^2 > \\chi_{2n, \\alpha}^2}) = \\alpha\\). Then, we reject \\(H_0\\) if \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 > \\frac{\\theta_0}{2} \\chi_{2n, \\alpha}^2}\\).\n\nTherefore, the UMP test rejects \\(H_0\\) if \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 > \\frac{\\theta_0}{2} \\chi_{2n, \\alpha}^2}\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 > \\frac{\\theta_0}{2} \\chi_{2n, \\alpha}^2}}\\)",
