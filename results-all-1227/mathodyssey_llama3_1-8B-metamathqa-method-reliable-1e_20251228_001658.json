      "generated_solution": "Let $f(n)$ be the minimum number of times that someone writes down different numbers in a game with $n$ people.\nWe can start by considering the case where there are 2 people playing the game. In this case, each person has exactly 1 friend, so they both write down different numbers.\nFor $n = 3$, we can consider the following example: person 1 writes down 1, person 2 writes down 2, and person 3 writes down 3. Person 1 divides 1 by 2 and tells person 2 the result, which is 0.5. Person 2 divides 2 by 2 and tells person 1 the result, which is 1. Person 3 divides 3 by 2 and tells person 1 and person 2 the result, which is 1.5. Person 1 writes down the sum of 0.5, 1, and 1.5, which is 3. Person 2 writes down the sum of 1, 1, and 1.5, which is 3. Person 3 writes down the sum of 1.5, 1.5, and 1.5, which is 4.5. Therefore, in this case, each person writes down different numbers 3 times.\nFor $n = 4$, we can consider the following example: person 1 writes down 1, person 2 writes down 2, person 3 writes down 3, and person 4 writes down 4. Person 1 divides 1 by 3 and tells person 2, person 3, and person 4 the result, which is 1/3. Person 2 divides 2 by 3 and tells person 1, person 3, and person 4 the result, which is 2/3. Person 3 divides 3 by 3 and tells person 1, person 2, and person 4 the result, which is 1. Person 4 divides 4 by 3 and tells person 1, person 2, and person 3 the result, which is 4/3. Person 1 writes down the sum of 1/3, 2/3, 1, and 4/3, which is 8/3. Person 2 writes down the sum of 2/3, 1, 1, and 4/3, which is 8/3. Person 3 writes down the sum of 1, 1, 1, and 4/3, which is 7/3. Person 4 writes down the sum of 4/3, 1, 1, and 1, which is 7/3. Therefore, in this case, each person writes down different numbers 3 times.\nWe can see that for $n = 2, 3, 4$, each person writes down different numbers 3 times.\nFor $n = 5$, we can consider the following example: person 1 writes down 1, person 2 writes down 2, person 3 writes down 3, person 4 writes down 4, and person 5 writes down 5. Person 1 divides 1 by 4 and tells person 2, person 3, person 4, and person 5 the result, which is 1/4. Person 2 divides 2 by 4 and tells person 1, person 3, person 4, and person 5 the result, which is 1/2. Person 3 divides 3 by 4 and tells person 1, person 2, person 4, and person 5 the result, which is 3/4. Person 4 divides 4 by 4 and tells person 1, person 2, person 3, and person 5 the result, which is 1. Person 5 divides 5 by 4 and tells person 1, person 2, person 3, and person 4 the result, which is 5/4. Person 1 writes down the sum of 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1, and 5/4, which is 3. Person 2 writes down the sum of 1/2, 1/4, 3/4, 1, and 5/4, which is 3. Person 3 writes down the sum of 3/4, 1/2, 1/4, 1, and 5/4, which is 3. Person 4 writes down the sum of 1, 1/2, 3/4, 1/4, and 5/4, which is 3. Person 5 writes down the sum of 5/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1, and 1/4, which is 3. Therefore, in this case, each person writes down different numbers 3 times.\nWe can see that for $n = 2, 3, 4, 5$, each person writes down different numbers 3 times.\nFor $n = 6$, we can consider the following example: person 1 writes down 1, person 2 writes down 2, person 3 writes down 3, person 4 writes down 4, person 5 writes down 5, and person 6 writes down 6. Person 1 divides 1 by 5 and tells person 2, person 3, person 4, person 5, and person 6 the result, which is 1/5. Person 2 divides 2 by 5 and tells person 1, person 3, person 4, person 5, and person 6 the result, which is 2/5. Person 3 divides 3 by 5 and tells person 1, person 2, person 4, person 5, and person 6 the result, which is 3/5. Person 4 divides 4 by 5 and tells person 1, person 2, person 3, person 5, and person 6 the result, which is 4/5. Person 5 divides 5 by 5 and tells person 1, person 2, person 3, person 4, and person 6 the result, which is 1. Person 6 divides 6 by 5 and tells person 1, person 2, person 3, person 4, and person 5 the result, which is 6/5. Person 1 writes down the sum of 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 1, and 6/5, which is 3.

Person 4 writes down the sum of 4/5, 2/5, 3/5, 1/5, 1, and 6/5, which is 3. Person 5 writes down the sum of 1, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 1/5, and 6/5, which is 3. Person 6 writes down the sum of 6/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 1, and 1/5, which is 3. Therefore, in this case, each person writes down different numbers 3 times.\nWe can see that for $n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$, each person writes down different numbers 3 times.\nTherefore, for any $n > 2$, each person writes down different numbers $\\boxed{3}$ times.The answer is: 3",

      "question": "The minimum force required to break a type of brick is normally distributed with mean 195 and variance 16. A random sample of 300 bricks is selected.\n    Estimate the probability that at most 30 of the selected bricks break under a force of 190.",

      "predicted_answer": "0.0",
      "generated_solution": "The mean of the normal distribution is 195 and the variance is 16, so the standard deviation is $\\sqrt{16}=4$.\nTo find the probability that at most 30 of the selected bricks break under a force of 190, we need to find the probability that the number of broken bricks is less than or equal to 30.\nThe number of broken bricks is normally distributed with mean 195 and standard deviation 4.\nWe can use the normal distribution table to find the probability that a normally distributed variable is less than or equal to a certain value.\nThe z-score corresponding to a value of 30 is $\\frac{30-195}{4}=-\\frac{165}{4}=-41.25$.\nUsing the normal distribution table, we find that the probability that a normally distributed variable is less than or equal to -41.25 is
