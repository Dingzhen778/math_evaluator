Given that the smallest side has length $6$, we have:\n   \\[\n   a = 6\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the side lengths are $6$, $6+d$, and $6+2d$.\n\n2. **Use the Law of Cosines:**\n   Given that the triangle has an angle of $120^\\circ$, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the relationship between the sides. The Law of Cosines states:\n   \\[\n   c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos(C)\n   \\]\n   Here, $C = 120^\\circ$, so $\\cos(120^\\circ) = -\\frac{1}{2}}$.

Solving for $d$, we get:\n   \\[\n   d = -6\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the side lengths:**\n   Substituting $d = -6$ into the side lengths, we get:\n   \\[\n   a = 6, \\quad a+d = 0, \\quad a+2d = -6\n   \\]\n   Since the side lengths must be positive, we discard the negative values. Therefore, the side lengths are $6$, $0$, and $-6$, which are not valid side lengths for a triangle.\n\nTherefore, there is no valid triangle with the given conditions.
