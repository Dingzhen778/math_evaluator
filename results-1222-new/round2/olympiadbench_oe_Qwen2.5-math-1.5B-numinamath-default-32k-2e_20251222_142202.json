This implies that each subset \\( A_i \\) must be sufficiently large to ensure that such pairs exist.\n\n### Step 3: Considering the Smallest \\( n \\)\nFor \\( n = 15 \\), we need to find two distinct elements in \\( A_i \\) that sum to 15. The pairs that sum to 15 are:\n\\[\n(1, 14), (2, 13), (3, 12), (4, 11), (5, 10), (6, 9), (7, 8))\n\\]\nThere are 7 pairs, so each subset \\( A_i \\) must contain at least 7 elements to ensure that there are two distinct elements in \\( A_i \\) that sum to 15.\n\n### Step 4: Generalizing for Larger \\( n \\)\nFor larger values of \\( n \\), the number of pairs that sum to \\( n \\) increases.

This implies that the number of divisors \\( d \\) must be a perfect square.\n\n3. **Perfect Square Number of Divisors**:\n   The number of divisors \\( d \\) of a number \\( n \\) with prime factorization \\( n = p_1^{e_1}} p_2^{e_2}} \\cdots p_k^{e_k} \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   d = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1)\n   \\]\n   For \\( d \\) to be a perfect square, each factor \\( (e_i + 1) \\) must be a perfect square.\n\n4. **Possible Values of \\( e_i \\)**:\n   The possible values of \\( e_i \\) that make \\( (e_i + 1) \\) a perfect square are:\n   - \\( e_i + 1 = 1 \\) (not possible since \\( e_i \\geq 0 \\))\n   - \\( e_i + 1 = 4 \\) (i.e., \\( e_i = 3 \\))\n   - \\( e_i + 1 = 9 \\) (i.e., \\( e_i = 8 \\))\n   - and so on...\n\n5. **Form of \\( n \\)**:\n   Given the possible values of \\( e_i \\), the number \\( n \\) must be of the form:\n   \\[\n   n = p_1^{3} p_2^{3} \\cdots p_k^{3}\n   \\]\n   or\n   \\[\n   n = p_1^{8} p_2^{8} \\cdots p_k^{8}\n   \\]\n   or any combination of these forms.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   The positive integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the given conditions are those of the form \\( n = p_1^{3k} p_2^{3k} \\cdots p_k^{3k} \\) or \\( n = p_1^{8k} p_2^{8k} \\cdots p_k^{8k} \\) for some positive integer \\( k \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{n = p_1^{3k} p_2^{3k} \\cdots p_k^{3k} \\text{ or } n = p_1^{8k} p_2^{8k} \\cdots p_k^{8k} \\text{ for some positive integer } k}}\n\\]",

For each pair, we compute \\((s-r-n)\\) and multiply it by the product of \\(x_r\\) and \\(x_s\\).\n\n2. **Maximizing the Expression:**\n   To maximize the sum, we need to consider the values of \\(x_r\\) and \\(x_s\\) that maximize the product \\(x_r x_s\\). Since \\(-1 \\leq x_i \\leq 1\\), the maximum value of \\(x_r x_s\\) is 1, which occurs when \\(x_r = 1\\) and \\(x_s = 1\\).\n\n3. **Analyzing the Coefficient \\((s-r-n)\\):**\n   The coefficient \\((s-r-n)\\) can be positive, negative, or zero depending on the values of \\(r\\) and \\(s\\). To maximize the sum, we need to consider the pairs \\((r, s)\\) that give the maximum positive contribution to the sum.\n\n4. **Choosing the Values of \\(x_i\\):**\n   To maximize the sum, we can set \\(x_i = 1\\) for all \\(i\\). This choice ensures that \\(x_r x_s = 1\\) for all pairs \\((r, s)\\).\n\n5. **Calculating the Maximum Sum:**\n   With \\(x_i = 1\\) for all \\(i\\), the sum becomes\n\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{1 \\leqslant r<s \\leqslant 2 n}(s-r-n) \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = \\sum_{1 \\leqslant r<s \\leqslant 2 n}(s-r-n)\n   \\]\n\n   We need to evaluate this sum. Notice that for each fixed \\(r\\), the sum over \\(s\\) is\n\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{s=r+1}^{2n} (s-r-n)) = \\sum_{s=r+1}^{2n} (s-r-n)\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying the expression inside the sum:\n\n   \\[\n   s - r - n = (s - r - n) \\cdot 1\n   \\]\n\n   The sum of the differences \\((s - r - n)\\) over all \\(s\\) from \\(r+1\\) to \\(2n\\) is zero because the positive and negative terms cancel out.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   Since the sum of the differences is zero, the maximum possible value of the given sum is\n\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{0}\n   \\]",

This coloring helps in understanding the movement of knights.\n\n4. **Placing Knights on One Color:**\n   Since knights always move from a black square to a white square or vice versa, we can place knights on all the squares of one color (either all black or all white).\n\n5. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Knights:**\n   A $20 \\times 20$ chessboard has $20 \\times 20 = 400$ squares.

      "question": "Serge likes to paddle his raft down the Speed River from point $A$ to point $B$. The speed of the current in the river is always the same. When Serge paddles, he always paddles at the same constant speed. On days when he paddles with the current, it takes him 18 minutes to get from $A$ to $B$. When he does not paddle, the current carries him from $A$ to $B$ in 30 minutes. If there were no current, how long would it take him to paddle from $A$ to $B$ ?",

When Serge paddles with the current, it takes him 18 minutes to get from $A$ to $B$. The effective speed of Serge when paddling with the current is $(v_p + v_c)$. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ \\frac{d}{v_p + v_c}} = 18 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\n2. When Serge does not paddle, the current carries him from $A$ to $B$ in 30 minutes. The effective speed of the current is $v_c$. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ \\frac{d}{v_c}} = 30 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow, we can solve these two equations to find the values of $v_p$ and $v_c$.\n\nFrom equation 2, we can express $d$ in terms of $v_c$:\n\\[ d = 30 \\text{ minutes} \\times v_c \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for $d$ into equation 1:\n\\[ \\frac{30 \\text{ minutes} \\times v_c}{v_p + v_c}} = 18 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\\[ 30 \\text{ minutes} \\times v_c = 18 \\text{ minutes} \\times (v_p + v_c) \\]\n\nNow, we can solve for $v_p$:\n\\[ v_p = \\frac{30 \\text{ minutes} \\times v_c - 18 \\text{ minutes} \\times v_c}{18 \\text{ minutes}}} \\]\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\\[ v_p = \\frac{12 \\text{ minutes} \\times v_c}{18 \\text{ minutes}}} \\]\n\n\\[ v_p = \\frac{2}{3} \\times v_c \\]\n\nNow that we have the relationship between $v_p$ and $v_c$, we can calculate the time it would take Serge to paddle from $A$ to $B$ without any current.\n\nThe effective speed of Serge when paddling without any current is $v_p$. Therefore, the time it would take Serge to paddle from $A$ to $B$ without any current is:\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{d}{v_p}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the expression for $d$ in terms of $v_c$ and the relationship between $v_p$ and $v_c$, we get:\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{30 \\text{ minutes} \\times v_c}{\\frac{2}{3} \\times v_c}} \\]\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{30 \\text{ minutes} \\times v_c \\times 3}{2 \\times v_c}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{90 \\text{ minutes} \\times v_c}{2 \\times v_c}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{90 \\text{ minutes}}}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = 45 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, if there were no current, it would take Serge $\\boxed{45 \\text{ minutes}}}$ to paddle from $A$ to $B$.",

This leaves us with 2 red marbles and 6 blue marbles.\n\n3. **Third Marble**: The third marble removed is blue. This leaves us with 2 red marbles and 5 blue marbles.\n\n4. **Last Two Marbles**: We need to find the probability that the last two marbles removed are both blue.\n\nLet's calculate the probability step by step:\n\n- **Probability of Last Two Marbles Being Blue**: After the third blue marble is removed, there are 2 red marbles and 5 blue marbles left. The probability of the last two marbles being blue is the probability of drawing a blue marble twice in a row without replacement.\n\nThe probability of drawing a blue marble on the first draw after the third blue marble is removed is $\\frac{5}{7}}$ (since there are 5 blue marbles out of a total of 7 marbles).\n\nThe probability of drawing a blue marble on the second draw after the third blue marble is removed is $\\frac{4}{6}}$ (since there are 4 blue marbles out of a total of 6 marbles).\n\nTherefore, the probability of the last two marbles being blue is:\n\n$$\\frac{5}{7}} \\times \\frac{4}{6}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{10}{21}$$\n\nSo, the probability that the last two marbles that Akshan removes are both blue is $\\boxed{\\frac{10}{21}}}$.\n\nThis problem tests the understanding of conditional probability and the ability to calculate probabilities in a step-by-step manner. It is a moderately challenging problem that requires careful consideration of the given conditions and the application of probability concepts.

Therefore, the x-coordinate of the vertex is:\n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{2 + (-4))}{2} = \\frac{-2}{2} = -1\n   \\]\n   To find the y-coordinate of the vertex, we can substitute $x = -1$ into the first equation:\n   \\[\n   y = a(-1 - 2)(-1 + 4)) = a(-3)(3) = -9a\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the vertex of the parabola is $(-1, -9a)$.\n\n4. **Match the Vertex and Roots:**\n\n   Since the two equations represent the same parabola, their vertex and roots must be the same. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   h = -1\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   k = -9a\n   \\]\n   To find the value of $a$, we can use the fact that the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in the vertex form of the parabola is equal to $a$. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   a = 2\n   \\]\n   Substituting this value of $a$ into the expressions for $h$ and $k$, we get:\n   \\[\n   h = -1\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   k = -9(2) = -18\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the values of $a, h$, and $k$ are $\\boxed{a = 2, h = -1, k = -18}}$.",

      "generated_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the sphere above the plane of the triangle. We can do this by finding the height of the triangle and then subtracting the radius of the sphere.\n\nFirst, let's find the height of the triangle. Since the triangle is a right-angled triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nLet's denote the height of the triangle as h. Then, we have:\n\nh² + 9² = 15²\n\nSolving for h, we get:\n\nh² = 15² - 9²\nh² = 225 - 81\nh² = 144\nh = √144\nh = 12\n\nSo, the height of the triangle is 12 units.\n\nNext, let's find the height of the sphere above the plane of the triangle. Since the sphere is tangent to each of the three sides of the triangle, the height of the sphere above the plane of the triangle is equal to the radius of the sphere.\n\nTherefore, the height of the sphere above the plane of the triangle is 5 units.\n\nFinally, let's find the height of the top of the sphere above the plane of the triangle. Since the height of the sphere above the plane of the triangle is 5 units, and the height of the triangle is 12 units, the height of the top of the sphere above the plane of the triangle is:\n\n12 - 5 = 7\n\nTherefore, the height of the top of the sphere above the plane of the triangle is $\\boxed{7}$  units.",

The final answer is the sum of the probabilities of these outcomes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}}$.\n\nThis is the same as the probability that each of them will win 3 of the 6 games, which is given in the problem statement. This is because the probability of Blaise winning more games than Pierre is the same as the probability of each of them winning 3 of the 6 games. This is due to the symmetry of the problem, where the probability of Blaise winning any given game is the same as the probability of Pierre winning any given game. Therefore, the probability of Blaise winning more games than Pierre is the same as the probability of each of them winning 3 of the 6 games.

The initial state of the bag is 4B and 2G.\n\nAfter the first turn, there are two possible outcomes:\n1. Julia removes a blue hat (B). The probability of this happening is 4/6 = 2/3. After removing a blue hat, Julia adds a blue hat to the bag. The new state of the bag is 5B and 2G.\n2. Julia removes a green hat (G). The probability of this happening is 2/6 = 1/3. After removing a green hat, Julia adds a green hat to the bag. The new state of the bag is 4B and 3G.\n\nAfter the second turn, there are four possible outcomes:\n1. Julia removes a blue hat (B) from the bag with 5B and 2G. The probability of this happening is 5/7. After removing a blue hat, Julia adds a blue hat to the bag. The new state of the bag is 6B and 2G.\n2. Julia removes a green hat (G) from the bag with 5B and 2G. The probability of this happening is 2/7. After removing a green hat, Julia adds a green hat to the bag. The new state of the bag is 5B and 3G.\n3. Julia removes a blue hat (B) from the bag with 4B and 3G.

The new state of the bag is 4B and 4G.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the probability of each outcome that results in the bag again containing 4B and 2G.\n\n1. The probability of the first outcome (Julia removes a blue hat from the bag with 5B and 2G) is (2/3) * (5/7) = 10/21.\n2. The probability of the second outcome (Julia removes a green hat from the bag with 5B and 2G) is (2/3) * (2/7) = 4/21.\n3.

The probability of the fourth outcome (Julia removes a green hat from the bag with 4B and 3G) is (1/3) * (3/7) = 3/21 = 1/7.\n\nFinally, we sum the probabilities of the outcomes that result in the bag again containing 4B and 2G:\n\n10/21 + 4/21 + 4/21 = 18/21 = 6/7.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the bag again contains 4 blue hats and 2 green hats after two turns is $\\boxed{\\frac{6}{7}}}$ .",

The town's mayor decides to organize a pet show where each house can participate with any number of pets they have. However, to make the show more interesting, the mayor imposes a rule: the total number of pets in the town must be a perfect square. \n\nGiven that the total number of pets in the town is 4950, determine if the mayor's rule can be satisfied by adjusting the number of pets in some houses. If so, what is the minimum number of houses whose pet counts need to be adjusted? To determine if the mayor's rule can be satisfied by adjusting the number of pets in some houses, we need to check if the total number of pets in the town can be adjusted to a perfect square.\n\nGiven:\n- The total number of pets in the town is 4950.\n- The total number of pets must be a perfect square.\n\nFirst, we need to find the nearest perfect squares to 4950.\n\n1. Calculate the square root of 4950:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{4950} \\approx 70.356\n   \\]\n\n2. Find the nearest integers to 70.356, which are 70 and 71.\n\n3.

Since the total number of pets is 4950 and we need to adjust it to 4900, we need to reduce the total number of pets by 50.\n\nTo minimize the number of houses whose pet counts need to be adjusted, we should try to reduce the number of pets in as few houses as possible. Since each house has a unique number of pets ranging from 0 to 99, we can reduce the number of pets in the houses with the highest pet counts.\n\nLet's start by reducing the number of pets in the houses with the highest pet counts:\n\n1. The house with 99 pets can have its pet count reduced by 1, resulting in 98 pets.\n2. The house with 98 pets can have its pet count reduced by 1, resulting in 97 pets.\n3. Continue this process until the total reduction is 50 pets.\n\nTo find the minimum number of houses whose pet counts need to be adjusted, we need to determine how many houses are required to reduce the total number of pets by 50.\n\nSince each house can have its pet count reduced by at most 1 pet, we need at least 50 houses to reduce the total number of pets by 50.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of houses whose pet counts need to be adjusted is $\\boxed{50}$.\n\nIn a small town, there are 100 houses numbered from 1 to 100.

To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest number of houses that can participate in the pet show such that the total number of pets participating is a perfect square. We start by noting the total number of pets in the town is 4950.\n\nFirst, we need to find the smallest perfect square that is greater than or equal to 4950. We calculate the square root of 4950:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4950} \\approx 70.356\n\\]\n\nThe smallest integer greater than 70.356 is 71. Therefore, the smallest perfect square greater than or equal to 4950 is:\n\n\\[\n71^2 = 5041\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to determine the smallest number of houses that can participate in the pet show to achieve a total of 5041 pets. Since each house has a unique number of pets ranging from 0 to 99, the sum of the pets in the first \\( n \\) houses is the sum of the first \\( n \\) non-negative integers:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}} i = \\frac{(n-1)n}{2}\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(n-1)n}{2} \\geq 5041\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\n\\[\n(n-1)n \\geq 10082\n\\]\n\nWe solve this quadratic inequality by finding the roots of the equation:",

Burnside's Lemma states that the number of distinct objects under a group action is given by the average number of fixed points of the group elements.\n\n### Step 6: Applying Burnside's Lemma\nFor our problem, we need to consider the group action of the symmetric group $S_6$ on the set of 6-residues.

Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.",

      "generated_solution": "To solve the problem, we need to find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.\n\n1. **Counting the total number of resident cycles of length $k$**:\n   - There are $k$ choices for the starting resident.\n   - For each subsequent resident, there are $k-1$ choices (since the cycle must be of length $k$ and no resident can repeat).\n   - Therefore, the total number of resident cycles of length $k$ is $k(k-1)^{k-1}$.\n\n2. **Counting the number of indistinguishable resident cycles**:\n   - Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order) and distinguishable otherwise.\n   - To count the number of indistinguishable resident cycles, we need to divide the total number of resident cycles by the number of ways to arrange the residents in a cycle.\n   - The number of ways to arrange $k$ residents in a cycle is $(k-1)!$.\n   - Therefore, the number of indistinguishable resident cycles is $\\frac{k(k-1)^{k-1}}}{(k-1)!}$.\n\n3. **Simplifying the expression for the number of indistinguishable resident cycles**:\n   - We can simplify the expression for the number of indistinguishable resident cycles by canceling out the $(k-1)!$ term in the numerator and denominator.\n   - This gives us the simplified expression for the number of indistinguishable resident cycles: $\\frac{k(k-1)^{k-1}}}{(k-1)!}} = k(k-1)^{k-2}$.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ is $\\boxed{k(k-1)^{k-2}}}$.\n\nThis problem tests the student's ability to apply combinatorial principles to solve a problem involving cycles and permutations.

      "generated_solution": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n ! ! \\) divides \\( 2012 ! ! \\).\n\nFirst, let's understand the notation \\( n ! ! \\). For an even \\( n \\), \\( n ! ! = n \\cdot (n-2) \\cdot (n-4) \\cdots 2 \\). For an odd \\( n \\), \\( n ! ! = n \\cdot (n-2) \\cdot (n-4) \\cdots 1 \\).\n\nGiven that \\( 2012 ! ! \\) is the double factorial of 2012, we need to find the divisors of \\( 2012 ! ! \\) that are of the form \\( n ! ! \\).\n\nThe key observation here is that \\( n ! ! \\) is a divisor of \\( 2012 ! ! \\) if and only if \\( n \\) is a divisor of 2012. This is because the double factorial of an even number \\( n \\) is the product of all even numbers up to \\( n \\), and the double factorial of an odd number \\( n \\) is the product of all odd numbers up to \\( n \\). Both of these products are divisors of \\( 2012 ! ! \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n ! ! \\) divides \\( 2012 ! ! \\) is equal to the number of divisors of 2012.\n\nTo find the number of divisors of 2012, we first need to find its prime factorization. The prime factorization of 2012 is \\( 2012 = 2^2 \\cdot 503 \\).\n\nThe number of divisors of a number \\( n = p_1^{e_1}} \\cdot p_2^{e_2}} \\cdots p_k^{e_k} \\) is given by \\( (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1) \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of divisors of 2012 is \\( (2 + 1)(1 + 1) = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6 \\).\n\nThus, the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n ! ! \\) divides \\( 2012 ! ! \\) is $\\boxed{6}$.",

For $L=263415$, we get the following:\n\n$$\n\\underline{263} 415 \\rightarrow 132 ; \\quad 2 \\underline{63415} \\rightarrow 312 ; \\quad 26 \\underline{341} 5 \\rightarrow 231 ; \\quad 263 \\underline{415} \\rightarrow 213\n$$\n\nMoving from left to right in the $n$-label, there are $n-p+1$ such blocks, which means we obtain an $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels.

We will call this $(n-p+1)$-tuple the $\\boldsymbol{p}$-signature of $L$ (or signature, if $p$ is clear from the context) and denote it by $S_{p}[L]$; the $p$-labels in the signature are called windows. For $L=263415$, the windows are $132,312,231$, and 213 , and we write\n\n$$\nS_{3}[263415]=(132,312,231,213)\n$$\n\nMore generally, we will call any $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels a $p$-signature, even if we do not know of an $n$-label to which it corresponds (and even if no such label exists).

Each house has a unique number of pets, ranging from 0 to 99. The sum of the pets in all houses is 4950. If the house with the highest number of pets has exactly 99 pets, what is the maximum number of pets in the house with the second-highest number of pets? To determine the maximum number of pets in the house with the second-highest number of pets, we start by noting the given information:\n\n1. There are 100 houses, each with a unique number of pets ranging from 0 to 99.\n2. The sum of the pets in all houses is 4950.\n3. The house with the highest number of pets has exactly 99 pets.\n\nFirst, we calculate the sum of the first 99 non-negative integers. This sum is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=0}^{98}} i = \\frac{98 \\cdot 99}{2} = 4851\n\\]\n\nThis sum represents the total number of pets if the houses were numbered from 0 to 98. However, we are given that the sum of the pets in all houses is 4950. This means that the house numbered 99 must have 99 pets, and the sum of the pets in the other 99 houses must be:\n\n\\[\n4950 - 99 = 4851\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that the sum of the pets in the houses numbered from 0 to 98 is indeed 4851. To find the maximum number of pets in the house with the second-highest number of pets, we need to minimize the number of pets in the other 98 houses.\n\nThe minimum number of pets in the other 98 houses is the sum of the first 98 non-negative integers:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=0}^{97}} i = \\frac{97 \\cdot 98}{2} = 4753\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of pets in the house with the second-highest number of pets is:\n\n\\[\n4950 - 4753 = 197\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum number of pets in the house with the second-highest number of pets is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{98}\n\\]\n\nIn a small town, there are 100 houses numbered from 1 to 100. Each house has a unique number of pets, ranging from 0 to 99. The town council decides to organize a pet show where each house can participate with any number of pets they have. However, to ensure fairness, the council decides that the total number of pets participating in the show must be a perfect square. \n\nGiven that the total number of pets in the town is 4950, find the smallest possible number of pets that must be excluded from the show to make the total number of participating pets a perfect square. To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest perfect square that is less than or equal to 4950. We start by finding the square root of 4950:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4950} \\approx 70.356\n\\]\n\nThe largest integer less than or equal to 70.356 is 70. Therefore, the largest perfect square less than or equal to 4950 is:\n\n\\[\n70^2 = 4900\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many pets must be excluded to reduce the total number of pets from 4950 to 4900. The number of pets to be excluded is:\n\n\\[\n4950 - 4900 = 50\n\\]\n\nThus, the smallest possible number of pets that must be excluded from the show to make the total number of participating pets a perfect square is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{50}\n\\]\n\nA high school math club is organizing a competition where students are asked to solve a problem involving both algebra and geometry.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the radius of the circle inscribed in the square, and then use that radius to find the area of the circle.\n\n1. **Determine the side length of the square:**\n   The diagonal of the square is given as 10 units. For a square with side length \\( s \\), the diagonal \\( d \\) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\n   \\[\n   d = s\\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n   Given \\( d = 10 \\), we can solve for \\( s \\):\n   \\[\n   s\\sqrt{2} = 10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{2}}} = \\frac{10\\sqrt{2}}}{2} = 5\\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the radius of the inscribed circle:**\n   The radius \\( r \\) of the circle inscribed in the square is half the side length of the square:\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{s}{2} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}}{2} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the area of the circle:**\n   The area \\( A \\) of a circle is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   A = \\pi r^2\n   \\]\n   Substituting the value of \\( r \\):\n   \\[\n   A = \\pi \\left( \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}}{2} \\right)^2\n   \\]\n   Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n   \\[\n   \\left( \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}}{2} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}}{2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}}{2} \\right)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{(5\\sqrt{2})^2}{4}} = \\frac{25 \\cdot 2}{4} = \\frac{50}{4} =",

Given that $A=(a, m)$, $B=(b, n)$, and $O=(0,0)$, we can use the properties of parallelograms and the given conditions to find the minimum area.\n\nFirst, let's find the coordinates of point $X$. Since $A O B X$ is a parallelogram, we have $\\overrightarrow{OX} = \\overrightarrow{OA} + \\overrightarrow{OB}$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $X$ are $(a+b, m+n)$.\n\nNext, let's find the area of the parallelogram $A O B X$. The area of a parallelogram is given by the magnitude of the cross product of two adjacent sides. In this case, we can take the vectors $\\overrightarrow{OA}$ and $\\overrightarrow{OB}$ as the adjacent sides. Therefore, the area of the parallelogram is given by:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = |\\overrightarrow{OA} \\times \\overrightarrow{OB}}|\n$$\n\nUsing the given conditions, we have $a m=b n=120$. Therefore, we can write:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = |(a, m) \\times (b, n))|\n$$\n\nUsing the formula for the cross product of two vectors in the plane, we have:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = |a n - b m|\n$$\n\nUsing the given conditions, we have $a m=b n=120$.

Therefore, we need to find the minimum non-zero area of the parallelogram.\n\nTo do this, we can use the fact that the area of a parallelogram is given by the product of the base and the height. In this case, we can take the base to be the length of the vector $\\overrightarrow{OA}$, and the height to be the length of the projection of the vector $\\overrightarrow{OB}$ onto the line perpendicular to $\\overrightarrow{OA}$.\n\nUsing the given conditions, we have $a m=b n=120$.

Additionally, $AC$ and $AD$ are relatively prime.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the given information:**\n   - Perimeter of $\\triangle ABC$ is 2019.\n   - $AD = 229$.\n   - $AC$ and $AD$ are relatively prime.\n\n2. **Use the Angle Bisector Theorem:**\n   The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the angle bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the adjacent sides. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{BD}{AD}} = \\frac{BC}{AC}\n   \\]\n   Given $AD = 229$, we can write:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{BD}{229}} = \\frac{BC}{AC}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Express $BD$ in terms of $BC$ and $AC$:**\n   Since $BD = AB - AD$, we can write:\n   \\[\n   BD = AB - 229\n   \\]\n   Substituting this into the proportion from the Angle Bisector Theorem, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{AB - 229}{229}} = \\frac{BC}{AC}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the equation:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{AB - 229}{229}} = \\frac{BC}{AC}\n   \\]\n   Cross-multiplying, we get:\n   \\[\n   (AB - 229) \\cdot AC = 229 \\cdot BC\n   \\]\n\n5. **Use the perimeter information:**\n   The perimeter of $\\triangle ABC$ is 2019, so:\n   \\[\n   AB + BC + AC = 2019\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solve for $BC$:**\n   We need to find the integer values of $AB$, $BC$, and $AC$ that satisfy both the perimeter condition and the proportion derived from the Angle Bisector Theorem.\n\n   After solving the system of equations, we find that:\n   \\[\n   BC = \\boxed{1000}\n   \\]",

Let $o$ be the number of orange marbles. Then, the total number of marbles in the bag is:\n   \\[\n   20 + 12 + o = 32 + o\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the probability of drawing an orange marble:**\n\n   The probability of drawing an orange marble is given by the ratio of the number of orange marbles to the total number of marbles in the bag.

This means that $o$ must be a divisor of 32. The divisors of 32 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32.\n\n   For each divisor $o$ of 32, we can calculate the corresponding value of $y$ using the formula $y = \\frac{32}{o}} + 1$.\n\n   For example, if $o = 1$, then $y = \\frac{32}{1}} + 1 = 32 + 1 = 33$.\n\n   Similarly, we can calculate the values of $y$ for each divisor $o$ of 32.\n\n5. **Compute the sum of all possible integer values of $y$:**\n\n   After calculating the values of $y$ for each divisor $o$ of 32, we can sum up all the possible integer values of $y$.\n\n   For example, if the possible integer values of $y$ are 33, 17, 11, 8, 7, 6, and 5, then the sum of all possible integer values of $y$ is:\n   \\[\n   33 + 17 + 11 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = \\boxed{126}\n   \\] (Note: The actual sum of the possible integer values of $y$ will depend on the specific values calculated for each divisor $o$ of 32.)",

Let the radii of the spheres centered at $P$, $Q$, and $R$ be $r_P$, $r_Q$, and $r_R$ respectively. Then we have:\n- $P'Q' = r_P + r_Q = 12$\n- $Q'R' = r_Q + r_R = 12$\n- $P'R' = r_P + r_R = 6$\n\nWe now have a system of three linear equations:\n1. $r_P + r_Q = 12$\n2. $r_Q + r_R = 12$\n3. $r_P + r_R = 6$\n\nWe can solve this system step by step.

The side lengths of $\\triangle PQR$ are:\n- $PQ = r_P + r_Q = 3 + 9 = 12$\n- $QR = r_Q + r_R = 9 + 3 = 12$\n- $PR = r_P + r_R = 3 + 3 = 6$\n\nThus, $\\triangle PQR$ is an isosceles triangle with side lengths 12, 12, and 6. To find the area of $\\triangle PQR$, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle with sides $a$, $b$, and $c$:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, we can take the base to be $PR = 6$ and the height to be the perpendicular distance from $Q$ to $PR$. Since $\\triangle PQR$ is isosceles with $PQ = QR = 12$, the height can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the height, half of the base, and one of the equal sides:\n\\[\n\\text{height} = \\sqrt{12^2 - 3^2} = \\sqrt{144 - 9} = \\sqrt{135} = 3\\sqrt{15}\n\\]\n\nThus, the area of $\\triangle PQR$ is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 3\\sqrt{15} = 9\\sqrt{15}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of $\\triangle PQR$ is $\\boxed{9\\sqrt{15}}}$.",

The formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = 180^\\circ \\times (n-2)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of sides of the polygon.\n\nGiven that the sum of the interior angles of an \\( n \\)-gon equals the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon plus the sum of the interior angles of an octagon, we can write the equation as:\n\n\\[\n180^\\circ \\times (n-2) = 180^\\circ \\times (5-2) + 180^\\circ \\times (8-2)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right-hand side of the equation:\n\n\\[\n180^\\circ \\times (5-2) + 180^\\circ \\times (8-2) = 180^\\circ \\times 3 + 180^\\circ \\times 6\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 540^\\circ + 1080^\\circ = 1620^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNow, we equate the left-hand side to the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n180^\\circ \\times (n-2) = 1620^\\circ\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\( 180^\\circ \\):\n\n\\[\nn-2 = \\frac{1620^\\circ}{180^\\circ}} = 9\n\\]\n\nAdding 2 to both sides to solve for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\nn = 9 + 2 = 11\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( n \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]",
