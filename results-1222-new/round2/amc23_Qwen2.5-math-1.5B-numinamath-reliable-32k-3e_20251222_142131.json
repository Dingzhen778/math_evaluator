      "generated_solution": "To solve the given problem, we need to analyze the inequality involving absolute values and determine the area of the region it defines in the coordinate plane.\n\nThe given inequality is:\n\\[ | | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1 \\]\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Inequality\nFirst, let's simplify the expression inside the absolute values. We know that \\( |x| \\) represents the absolute value of \\( x \\). Therefore, we can rewrite the inequality as:\n\\[ | | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Absolute Values\nWe need to consider the different cases for \\( |x| \\) and \\( |y| \\).\n\n#### Case 1: \\( |x| \\ge 1 \\)\nIn this case, \\( |x| - 1 \\ge 0 \\), so \\( | |x| - 1| = |x| - 1 \\).\n\nSimilarly, for \\( |y| \\ge 1 \\), we have \\( | |y| - 1| = |y| - 1 \\).\n\nSubstituting these into the inequality, we get:\n\\[ (|x| - 1) + (|y| - 1)) \\le 1 \\]\n\\[ |x| + |y| - 2 \\le 1 \\]\n\\[ |x| + |y| \\le 3 \\]\n\n#### Case 2: \\( |x| < 1 \\)\nIn this case, \\( |x| - 1 < 0 \\), so \\( | |x| - 1| = 1 - |x| \\).\n\nSimilarly, for \\( |y| < 1 \\), we have \\( | |y| - 1| = 1 - |y| \\).\n\nSubstituting these into the inequality, we get:\n\\[ (1 - |x|) + (1 - |y|)) \\le 1 \\]\n\\[ 2 - |x| - |y| \\le 1 \\]\n\\[ 1 \\le |x| + |y| \\]\n\n### Step 3: Combine the Cases\nFrom the analysis above, we have two regions defined by the inequality:\n1. \\( |x| + |y| \\le 3 \\)\n2. \\( 1 \\le |x| + |y| \\)\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Area of Each Region\n#### Region 1: \\( |x| + |y| \\le 3 \\)\nThis region is a diamond (or rhombus) centered at the origin with vertices at \\((3,0)\\), \\((0,3)\\), \\((-3,0)\\), and \\((0,-3)\\).\n\nThe area \\( A \\) of a diamond with diagonals of length \\( d_1 \\) and \\( d_2 \\) is given by:\n\\[ A = \\frac{1}{2} d_1 d_2 \\]\n\nFor our diamond, the diagonals are both 6 (since the vertices are at \\((3,0)\\), \\((0,3)\\), \\((-3,0)\\), and \\((0,-3)\\)).\n\nThus, the area is:\n\\[ A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 6 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 36 = 18 \\]\n\n#### Region 2: \\( 1 \\le |x| + |y| \\)\nThis region is the area outside the diamond \\( |x| + |y| \\le 1 \\) but inside the diamond \\( |x| + |y| \\le 3 \\).\n\nThe area of the diamond \\( |x| + |y| \\le 1 \\) is:\n\\[ A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 = 2 \\]\n\nThus, the area of the region \\( 1 \\le |x| + |y| \\le 3 \\) is:\n\\[ 18 - 2 = 16 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe area of the region defined by the given inequality is:\n\\[ \\boxed{16} \\]",
