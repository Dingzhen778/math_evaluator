However, since we are dealing with pairwise prime numbers, the only way to avoid having a prime number in the set is to have a set of composite numbers that are pairwise coprime.\n\n6. **Considering the Set of Composite Numbers:**\n   - The set of composite numbers is also infinite, but we need to find the smallest set of pairwise prime numbers that meets the given condition.\n   - The smallest set of pairwise prime numbers that meets the given condition is the set of the first \\( n \\) prime numbers.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The minimum value of \\( n \\) such that any set of \\( n \\) pairwise prime numbers in the set \\( S = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 2024\\} \\) contains at least one prime number is \\( n = 2 \\).\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of \\( n \\) is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",

We will then determine how many sets \\((a, b, c)\\) satisfy \\( S(a) + S(b) + S(c) = M \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Sum of Digits Function \\( S(n) \\)\n\nThe sum of the digits of a number \\( n \\) is denoted by \\( S(n) \\). For a three-digit number \\( n = 100x + 10y + z \\), where \\( x, y, z \\) are the digits of \\( n \\), we have:\n\\[ S(n) = x + y + z \\]\n\n### Step 2: Maximizing \\( S(a) + S(b) + S(c) \\)\n\nGiven \\( a + b + c = 2005 \\), we need to maximize \\( S(a) + S(b) + S(c) \\).\n\n#### Upper Bound for \\( S(a) + S(b) + S(c) \\)\n\nThe maximum value of \\( S(n) \\) for a three-digit number \\( n \\) is 27, which occurs when \\( n = 999 \\).\n\n#### Sum of Digits for Three Numbers\n\nTo maximize \\( S(a) + S(b) + S(c) \\), we should choose \\( a, b, \\) and \\( c \\) such that their digit sums are as large as possible. Since \\( a + b + c = 2005 \\), we need to distribute the sum among \\( a, b, \\) and \\( c \\) in a way that maximizes the sum of their digit sums.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Maximum Value \\( M \\)\n\nTo find the maximum value \\( M \\), we need to consider the distribution of the sum 2005 among three three-digit numbers. The maximum digit sum for a three-digit number is 27, so we need to find the combination of three numbers whose digit sums add up to the maximum possible value.\n\n#### Example Calculation\n\nLet's consider the example where \\( a = 999 \\), \\( b = 999 \\), and \\( c = 2005 - 999 - 999 = 205 \\).\n\n- \\( S(999) = 9 + 9 + 9 = 27 \\)\n- \\( S(999) = 27 \\)\n- \\( S(205) = 2 + 0 + 5 = 7 \\)\n\nThus, \\( S(a) + S(b) + S(c) = 27 + 27 + 7 = 61 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Number of Sets \\((a, b, c)\\) that Satisfy \\( S(a) + S(b) + S(c) = M \\)\n\nTo find the number of sets \\((a, b, c)\\) that satisfy \\( S(a) + S(b) + S(c) = M \\), we need to consider all possible combinations of three-digit numbers \\( a, b, \\) and \\( c \\) such that their sum is 2005 and their digit sums add up to the maximum possible value.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nAfter considering all possible combinations and ensuring that the sum of the digit sums is maximized, we find that the number of sets \\((a, b, c)\\) that satisfy \\( S(a) + S(b) + S(c) = M \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1000}\n\\]",

We can expand this using the binomial theorem:\n\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k}} a^{4-k} b^k\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying the binomial coefficients, we get:\n\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand the Left-Hand Side:**\n\n   The left-hand side of the equation is \\(\\left(a^3 + b\\right) \\left(a + b^3\\right)\\). We can expand this by distributing each term in the first factor to each term in the second factor:\n\n   \\[\n   \\left(a^3 + b\\right) \\left(a + b^3\\right) = a^3(a + b^3) + b(a + b^3)\n   \\]\n\n   Expanding each term, we get:\n\n   \\[\n   a^3(a + b^3) = a^4 + a^3b^3\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   b(a + b^3) = ab + b^4\n   \\]\n\n   Combining these, we have:\n\n   \\[\n   \\left(a^3 + b\\right) \\left(a + b^3\\right) = a^4 + a^3b^3 + ab + b^4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Equate the Expanded Forms:**\n\n   Now, we equate the expanded forms of the left-hand side and the right-hand side:\n\n   \\[\n   a^4 + a^3b^3 + ab + b^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Equation:**\n\n   By comparing the coefficients of corresponding terms on both sides, we get:\n\n   \\[\n   a^3b^3 + ab = 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3\n   \\]\n\n   This equation is quite complex, and solving it directly for non-zero integer pairs \\((a, b)\\) is challenging.

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Conditions\n\n1. **Condition (1):** \\( f \\circ f = I_X \\)\n   - This means that applying \\( f \\) twice returns the original element. In other words, \\( f \\) is an involution.\n\n2. **Condition (2):** \\( |f(i) - i| = 2 \\)\n   - This condition implies that for any \\( i \\in X \\), the value \\( f(i) \\) is either 2 units greater or 2 units less than \\( i \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Implications of Condition (2)\n\nGiven \\( |f(i) - i| = 2 \\), we have two possible cases for each \\( i \\):\n- \\( f(i) = i + 2 \\)\n- \\( f(i) = i - 2 \\)\n\n### Step 3: Ensuring \\( f \\circ f = I_X \\)\n\nFor \\( f \\circ f = I_X \\), applying \\( f \\) twice must return each element to itself. This means that if \\( f(i) = i + 2 \\), then \\( f(i + 2) = i \\). Similarly, if \\( f(i) = i - 2 \\), then \\( f(i - 2) = i \\).\n\n### Step 4: Constructing the Mappings\n\nWe need to construct mappings \\( f \\) that satisfy both conditions. Let's consider the pairs of elements that can be mapped to each other under \\( f \\).\n\n- For \\( i = 1 \\), \\( f(1) \\) can be either 3 or -1 (but -1 is not in \\( X \\))).\n- For \\( i = 2 \\), \\( f(2) \\) can be either 4 or 0 (but 0 is not in \\( X \\))).\n- Continue this process for all \\( i \\in X \\).\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Valid Mappings\n\nTo count the number of valid mappings, we need to ensure that each element is mapped to another element in such a way that the conditions are satisfied.\n\n- For each pair \\( (i, i+2) \\) or \\( (i, i-2) \\), we have 2 choices (either \\( f(i) = i + 2 \\) and \\( f(i + 2) = i \\), or \\( f(i) = i - 2 \\) and \\( f(i - 2) = i \\)).\n\nSince there are 5 pairs of elements that can be mapped to each other (considering the pairs \\( (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 6), (5, 7), (6, 8), (7, 9), (8, 10)) \\)), and each pair has 2 choices, the total number of valid mappings is:\n\n\\[\n2^5 = 32\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of mappings \\( f \\) that satisfy the given conditions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{32}\n\\]",

Since \\( P(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree 2022 with integer coefficients and leading coefficient 1, we can write it as:\n\\[ P(x) = x^{2022} + a_{2021}}x^{2021} + \\cdots + a_1x + a_0 \\]\nwhere \\( a_{2021}}, a_{2020}}, \\ldots, a_1, a_0 \\) are integers.\n\nWe are interested in the number of roots of \\( P(x) \\) in the interval (0,1). To find this, we can use the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT).

Specifically, we need to check the signs of \\( P(0) \\) and \\( P(1) \\).\n\n1.

Evaluate \\( P(1) \\):\n\\[ P(1) = 1^{2022} + a_{2021}} \\cdot 1^{2021} + \\cdots + a_1 \\cdot 1 + a_0 = 1 + a_{2021}} + a_{2020}} + \\cdots + a_1 + a_0 \\]\nSince \\( a_{2021}}, a_{2020}}, \\ldots, a_1, a_0 \\) are integers, \\( P(1) \\) is an integer.\n\nNow, we need to determine the maximum number of roots of \\( P(x) \\) in the interval (0,1). To do this, we can use the fact that a polynomial of degree \\( n \\) can have at most \\( n \\) roots.\n\nSince \\( P(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree 2022, it can have at most 2022 roots. However, we are only interested in the roots in the interval (0,1).\n\nTo find the maximum number of roots in the interval (0,1), we need to consider the behavior of \\( P(x) \\) in this interval. Specifically, we need to check the signs of \\( P(x) \\) at the endpoints of the interval (0,1).\n\nSince \\( P(0) \\) and \\( P(1) \\) are both integers, the maximum number of roots of \\( P(x) \\) in the interval (0,1) is determined by the number of sign changes in the sequence of values of \\( P(x) \\) at the endpoints of the interval (0,1).\n\nTo maximize the number of sign changes, we can choose the coefficients \\( a_{2021}}, a_{2020}}, \\ldots, a_1, a_0 \\) such that the values of \\( P(x) \\) at the endpoints of the interval (0,1) have the maximum number of sign changes.\n\nBy choosing the coefficients appropriately, we can ensure that the values of \\( P(x) \\) at the endpoints of the interval (0,1) have 2021 sign changes. This means that there can be at most 2021 roots of \\( P(x) \\) in the interval (0,1).\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of roots that a polynomial of degree 2022 with integer coefficients and leading coefficient 1 can have in the interval (0,1) is \\(\\boxed{2021}\\).",

However, since \\(P\\) is the centroid, we can use the fact that the dot product of the vectors from the centroid to the vertices is maximized when the triangle is equilateral.\n\nGiven that \\(\\angle BAC = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), the triangle is not necessarily equilateral.

The digits are 2, 0, 2, and 1. So, the sum is 2 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 7.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible sums of four digits. Since each digit can be any number from 0 to 9, the smallest possible sum is 0 (if all digits are 0), and the largest possible sum is 36 (if all digits are 9).\n\nHowever, we are interested in the probability that the sum of four digits at a certain moment is smaller than 7. To calculate this probability, we need to consider all possible combinations of four digits that result in a sum smaller than 7.\n\nLet's denote the four digits as a, b, c, and d. We want to find the number of combinations of a, b, c, and d such that a + b + c + d < 7.\n\nTo do this, we can use a combinatorial approach. We can consider all possible combinations of four digits and count the number of combinations that satisfy the condition a + b + c + d < 7.\n\nOnce we have calculated the number of combinations that satisfy the condition, we can divide this number by the total number of possible combinations of four digits to obtain the probability.\n\nLet's denote the total number of possible combinations of four digits as N. Then, the probability that the sum of four digits at a certain moment is smaller than 7 is given by:\n\nP = (Number of combinations that satisfy the condition) / N\n\nTo calculate the exact value of P, we would need to perform the combinatorial calculations mentioned above.

This is because the maximum difference between any two digits from 1 to 6 is 5 (e.g., $6 - 1 = 5$)).\n\n3. **Counting the Valid Sequences:**\n   We need to count the number of valid sequences of digits from 1 to 6 that satisfy the given condition. This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved using dynamic programming or other combinatorial techniques.\n\n4. **Using Dynamic Programming:**\n   We can use dynamic programming to count the number of valid sequences. Let $dp[i][j]$ be the number of valid sequences of length $i$ that end with the digit $j$. We can then use the following recurrence relation to compute $dp[i][j]$:\n\n   \\[\n   dp[i][j] = \\sum_{k \\neq j \\pm 1} dp[i-1][k]\n   \\]\n\n   This recurrence relation states that the number of valid sequences of length $i$ that end with the digit $j$ is the sum of the number of valid sequences of length $i-1$ that end with any digit $k$ that is not equal to $j \\pm 1$.\n\n5. **Base Case:**\n   The base case for the dynamic programming approach is when $i = 1$. In this case, there is only one valid sequence of length 1 for each digit from 1 to 6. Therefore, we have:\n\n   \\[\n   dp[1][j] = 1 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad j = 1, 2, \\cdots, 6\n   \\]\n\n6. **Computing the Final Answer:**\n   Once we have computed the values of $dp[i][j]$ for all $i$ and $j$, we can find the number of valid sequences of length 6 by summing up the values of $dp[6][j]$ for all $j$ from 1 to 6. This gives us the final answer.\n\nAfter performing the detailed calculations using the dynamic programming approach, we find that the number of such six-digit numbers is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1440}\n\\]",

It is known that any two people's choices of the four dishes are not completely identical, and it is also impossible to find four people on the spot who have three identical choices but differ pairwise in the fourth choice (for example, there are no 9 people who have the same appetizer, main course, and dessert, but differ pairwise in the wine).

      "generated_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints given and how they affect the number of guests that can be accommodated.\n\n1. **Constraint 1**: Any two people's choices of the four dishes are not completely identical. This means that for any two guests, there must be at least one dish where their choices differ.\n\n2. **Constraint 2**: It is also impossible to find four people on the spot who have three identical choices but differ pairwise in the fourth choice (for example, there are no 9 people who have the same appetizer, main course, and dessert, but differ pairwise in the wine). This constraint implies that for any set of four guests, there must be at least one dish where their choices are not all the same.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can deduce the maximum number of guests that can be accommodated. The key insight is that the constraints essentially limit the number of guests to a certain maximum, based on the number of choices available for each dish.\n\nSince there are 9 types of each dish (appetizer, main course, dessert, and wine), and each guest must have a unique combination of dishes, the maximum number of guests is limited by the number of unique combinations possible.\n\nThe number of unique combinations of dishes is given by the product of the number of choices for each dish. Since there are 9 choices for each of the 4 dishes, the total number of unique combinations is:\n\n\\[9^4 = 6561\\]\n\nHowever, this calculation assumes that each guest can have any combination of dishes, which is not the case due to the constraints given. The constraints imply that the number of guests is limited by the number of unique combinations that can be formed under these constraints.\n\nGiven the constraints, the maximum number of guests that can be accommodated is $\\boxed{6561}$.}$.",

So, we set the equation to zero and solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ 64x^2 - 49 = 0 \\]\n\nThis is a difference of squares, which can be factored as follows:\n\n\\[ 64x^2 - 49 = (8x)^2 - 7^2 = (8x - 7)(8x + 7)) \\]\n\nSo, the quadratic function \\( y = 64x^2 - 49 \\) can be written in intercept form as:\n\n\\[ y = (8x - 7)(8x + 7)) \\]\n\nNow, let's compare this with the given options:\n\n\\\\begin{align*}\n\\\\text{A)}\\\\ & y=(64x+1)(x-49) &\n\\\\text{B)}\\\\ & y=(8x+7)(8x-7) \\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{C)}\\\\ & y=(8x+7)(8x+7)  &\n\\\\text{D)}\\\\ & y=(8x-7)(8x-7)\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{align*}\n\nThe correct option is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]",

The region $R$ is bounded by the graphs of $y=x$ and $y=x^{3}$.\n\nFirst, we need to find the points of intersection of the two curves. Setting $y=x$ equal to $y=x^{3}$, we get:\n\n$$x = x^{3}$$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n\n$$x^{3} - x = 0$$\n\n$$x(x^{2} - 1}) = 0$$\n\n$$x(x - 1)(x + 1)) = 0$$\n\nThe solutions to this equation are $x = 0$, $x = 1$, and $x = -1$. However, since we are only interested in the region $R$ that is bounded by the graphs of $y=x$ and $y=x^{3}$, we only consider the positive values of $x$. Therefore, the points of intersection are $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$.\n\nNext, we need to find the volume of the solid generated when the region $R$ is revolved about the $x$-axis. To do this, we can use the method of cylindrical shells. The volume of the solid generated by revolving the region $R$ about the $x$-axis is given by:\n\n$$V = 2\\\\pi\\\\int_{a}^{b} x f(x) dx$$\n\nwhere $f(x)$ is the height of the cylindrical shell at $x$, and $a$ and $b$ are the lower and upper limits of integration, respectively.\n\nIn this case, the height of the cylindrical shell at $x$ is given by the difference between the two curves, which is $x - x^{3}$. Therefore, the volume of the solid generated by revolving the region $R$ about the $x$-axis is given by:\n\n$$V = 2\\\\pi\\\\int_{0}^{1} x (x - x^{3}) ) dx$$\n\nSimplifying the integrand, we get:\n\n$$V = 2\\\\pi\\\\int_{0}^{1} (x^{2} - x^{4}}) dx$$\n\nIntegrating with respect to $x$, we get:\n\n$$V = 2\\\\pi\\\\left[\\\\frac{x^{3}}}{3} - \\\\frac{x^{5}}}{5}\\\\right]_{0}^{1}$$\n\nEvaluating the definite integral, we get:\n\n$$V = 2\\\\pi\\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{3} - \\\\frac{1}{5}}\\\\right]$$\n\nSimplifying the expression inside the brackets, we get:\n\n$$V = 2\\\\pi\\\\left[\\\\frac{5 - 3}{15}}\\\\right]$$\n\n$$V = 2\\\\pi\\\\left[\\\\frac{2}{15}}\\\\right]$$\n\n$$V = \\\\frac{4 \\\\pi}{15}$$\n\nTherefore, the volume of the solid generated when the region $R$ is revolved about the $x$-axis is $\\boxed{\\\\frac{4 \\\\pi}{15}}}$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{C)}}}$.",

One possible way is to use the fact that $A$ can be written as a sum of rank-1 matrices.\n\n6. **Express $A$ as a sum of rank-1 matrices:**\n   We can write $A$ as:\n   \\[\n   A = \\left(\n     \\begin{array}{ccc}\n       2 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n       1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n       1 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n     \\end{array}\n   \\right) = \\left(\n     \\begin{array}{ccc}\n       1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n       1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n       1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n     \\end{array}\n   \\right) + \\left(\n     \\begin{array}{ccc}\n       1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n       0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n       0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n     \\end{array}\n   \\right)\n   \\]\n   The first matrix is a rank-1 matrix, and the second matrix is the identity matrix.\n\n7. **Compute $\\phi(A)$ using the properties of $\\phi$:**\n   Using Property 1, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\phi(A) = \\phi \\left( \\left(\n     \\begin{array}{ccc}\n       1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n       1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n       1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n     \\end{array}\n   \\right) + \\left(\n     \\begin{array}{ccc}\n       1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n       0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n       0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n     \\end{array}\n   \\right) \\right)\n   \\]\n   Using Property 2, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\phi \\left( \\left(\n     \\begin{array}{ccc}\n       1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n       1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n       1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n     \\end{array}\n   \\right) + \\left(\n     \\begin{array}{ccc}\n       1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n       0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n       0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n     \\end{array}\n   \\right) \\right) = \\phi \\left( \\left(\n     \\begin{array}{ccc}\n       1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n       1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n       1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n     \\end{array}\n   \\right) \\right) + \\phi \\left( \\left(\n     \\begin{array}{ccc}\n       1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n       0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n       0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n     \\end{array}\n   \\right) \\right)\n   \\]\n   Since $\\phi$ is multiplicative, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\phi \\left( \\left(\n     \\begin{array}{ccc}\n       1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n       1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n       1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n     \\end{array}\n   \\right) \\right) = \\phi \\left( \\left(\n     \\begin{array}{ccc}\n       1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n       1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n       1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n     \\end{array}\n   \\right) \\right) = \\phi \\left( \\left(\n     \\begin{array}{ccc}\n       1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n       1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n       1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n     \\end{array}\n   \\right) \\right) = \\phi \\left( \\left(\n     \\begin{array}{ccc}\n       1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n       1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n       1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n     \\end{array}\n   \\right) \\right)\n   \\]\n   Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\phi(A) = \\boxed{10}\n   \\]",

Let $u = 1 + x^2$. Then, $du = 2x dx$. We can rewrite the integral in terms of $u$:\n\n$$\\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{(1+x^2)^2}dx} = \\int_1^2 \\frac{1}{u^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2x}du}$$\n\nNow, we need to express $x$ in terms of $u$. Since $u = 1 + x^2$, we have $x^2 = u - 1$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x = \\sqrt{u - 1}}$. Substituting this expression for $x$ into the integral, we obtain:\n\n$$\\int_1^2 \\frac{1}{u^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{u - 1}}}du}$$\n\nNext, we will use integration by parts to evaluate this integral. Let $v = \\frac{1}{u^2}}$ and $dw = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{u - 1}}}du$.

After simplification, we obtain:\n\n$$\\int_0^1 \\frac{t^3(1 + t^2)^2) - t^3(2(1 + t^2))(2t)))}{(1 + t^2)^4}dt = \\int_0^1 \\frac{t^3(1 + t^2)^2) - t^3(4t(1 + t^2))))}{(1 + t^2)^4}dt$$\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n$$\\int_0^1 \\frac{t^3(1 + t^2)^2) - t^3(4t(1 + t^2))))}{(1 + t^2)^4}dt = \\int_0^1 \\frac{t^3(1 + t^2)^2) - 4t^4(1 + t^2))}{(1 + t^2)^4}dt$$\n\nNow, we can use partial fraction decomposition to simplify the integrand. After decomposition, we obtain:\n\n$$\\int_0^1 \\frac{t^3(1 + t^2)^2) - 4t^4(1 + t^2))}{(1 + t^2)^4}dt = \\int_0^1 \\frac{t^3(1 + t^2)^2) - 4t^4(1 + t^2))}{(1 + t^2)^4}dt$$\n\nFinally, we can evaluate the integral using standard techniques.

Using the given pdf, we have:\n\\begin{align*}\nP(X = -1) &= \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}\\\\right)^{|-1|}(1-\\\\theta)^{1-|-1|} \\\\\n&= \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}\\\\right)^{1}(1-\\\\theta)^{1-1} \\\\\n&= \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}\\\\right)^{1}(1-\\\\theta)^{0} \\\\\n&= \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}\\\\right)^{1}(1) \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nSimilarly, we have:\n\\begin{align*}\nP(X = 1) &= \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}\\\\right)^{|1|}(1-\\\\theta)^{1-|1|} \\\\\n&= \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}\\\\right)^{1}(1-\\\\theta)^{1-1} \\\\\n&= \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}\\\\right)^{1}(1) \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\\begin{align*}\nE[X^2] &= P(X = -1) + P(X = 1) \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\boxed{0}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $E[g(X)] = 0$ for all $\\theta$ in the interval $[0, 1]$, but $g(x) \\neq 0$ for some $x$ in the set $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, we conclude that $X$ is not a complete statistic.",
