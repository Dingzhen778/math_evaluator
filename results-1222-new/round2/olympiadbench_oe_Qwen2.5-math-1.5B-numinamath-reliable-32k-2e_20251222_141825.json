Since $N$ is a positive integer not exceeding 5000, there are 5000 possible values for $N$.\n   - Therefore, the total number of possible combinations of $S$ and $N$ is $2^{20} \\times 5000$.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Sergey needs to determine the set $S$ and the number $N$ for each possible combination, the number of moves Sergey needs to determine the number $N$ is $\\boxed{20}$.",

Each plane contains \\( n^2 \\) points from \\( S \\) because for each fixed value of \\( x, y, \\) or \\( z \\) (which is 1 in these planes), the other two coordinates can take any value from 0 to \\( n \\).\n\nSince there are 3 such planes, the total number of points covered by these planes is:\n\\[\n3n^2\n\\]\nWe need to check if this is sufficient to cover all points in \\( S \\). Since \\( n \\) is even, \\( n^2 \\) is a perfect square, and the planes \\( x = 1, y = 1, z = 1 \\) will cover all points in \\( S \\) without any overlap.\n\n#### Case 2: \\( n \\) is odd\nIf \\( n \\) is odd, we can use the following planes:\n\\[\nx = 1, \\quad y = 1, \\quad z = 1\n\\]\nThese planes are parallel to the coordinate planes and do not pass through the origin. Each plane contains \\( n^2 \\) points from \\( S \\) because for each fixed value of \\( x, y, \\) or \\( z \\) (which is 1 in these planes), the other two coordinates can take any value from 0 to \\( n \\).\n\nSince there are 3 such planes, the total number of points covered by these planes is:\n\\[\n3n^2\n\\]\nWe need to check if this is sufficient to cover all points in \\( S \\). Since \\( n \\) is odd, \\( n^2 \\) is an odd perfect square, and the planes \\( x = 1, y = 1, z = 1 \\) will cover all points in \\( S \\) without any overlap.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn both cases (whether \\( n \\) is even or odd), the smallest number of planes that can contain all the points in \\( S \\) but none of them passes through the origin is 3.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]",

This product is:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{\\substack{p<q \\leqslant n \\\\ p, q \\text { primes }}}(p+q)\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Prime Factorization of \\( n! \\)\nThe factorial \\( n! \\) is the product of all positive integers up to \\( n \\).

The product will generally be much larger than \\( n! \\), making it more likely that \\( n! \\) will divide the product.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter analyzing the problem and considering the small values of \\( n \\), we find that the only value of \\( n \\) that satisfies the given condition is \\( n = 5 \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",

The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that contains all the points.\n   - The convex hull will have at least 3 vertices (since no three points are collinear).\n\n4. **Drawing Lines to Separate Points:**\n   - To separate the red and blue points, we need to draw lines that pass through pairs of points such that all red points are on one side of the line and all blue points are on the other side.\n   - We can draw a line through any two points. If the line separates the red and blue points, we are done.\n\n5. **Counting the Minimum Number of Lines:**\n   - To ensure that we can always draw lines to separate the red and blue points, we need to consider the worst-case scenario.\n   - In the worst-case scenario, we might need to draw lines through pairs of points to ensure that all red points are on one side and all blue points are on the other side.\n\n6. **Calculating the Minimum Number of Lines:**\n   - Since we have 2013 red points and 2014 blue points, we need to draw lines such that each line separates at least one red point from one blue point.\n   - The minimum number of lines required to separate all red points from all blue points is equal to the number of red points, which is 2013.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe minimal value of \\( k \\) such that the goal is attainable for every possible configuration of 4027 points is \\(\\boxed{2013}\\).",

      "generated_solution": "To solve the inequality $0<\\frac{x^{2}-11}{x+1}<7$, we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.\n\n#### Step 1: Solve the Inequality $0<\\frac{x^{2}-11}{x+1}$\n\nFirst, we need to find the values of $x$ for which the fraction $\\frac{x^{2}-11}{x+1}}$ is positive. This can be done by analyzing the sign of the numerator and the denominator separately.\n\n1. **Numerator Analysis**: $x^{2}-11$\n   - This is a quadratic equation. To find its roots, we set the equation to zero and solve for $x$:\n     \\[\n     x^{2}-11=0\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x^{2}=11\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x=\\pm\\sqrt{11}\n     \\]\n   - The roots of the numerator are $x=\\sqrt{11}$ and $x=-\\sqrt{11}$. These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: $(-\\infty, -\\sqrt{11}})$, $(-\\sqrt{11}, \\sqrt{11}})$, and $(\\sqrt{11}, \\infty)$.\n\n2. **Denominator Analysis**: $x+1$\n   - The denominator is zero when $x=-1$. This value divides the real number line into two intervals: $(-\\infty, -1)$ and $(-1, \\infty)$.\n\n3. **Sign Analysis**: Combining the intervals from the numerator and the denominator, we find that the fraction $\\frac{x^{2}-11}{x+1}}$ is positive in the intervals $(-\\infty, -\\sqrt{11}})$, $(-\\sqrt{11}, -1)}$, $(-1, \\sqrt{11}})$, and $(\\sqrt{11}, \\infty)$.\n\n#### Step 2: Solve the Inequality $\\frac{x^{2}-11}{x+1}<7$\n\nNext, we need to find the values of $x$ for which the fraction $\\frac{x^{2}-11}{x+1}}$ is less than 7. This can be done by setting up an inequality and solving for $x$.\n\n1. **Inequality Setup**: $\\frac{x^{2}-11}{x+1}<7$\n   - To solve this inequality, we can subtract 7 from both sides and then multiply both sides by $(x+1)$, assuming $x \\neq -1$ to avoid division by zero.\n\n2. **Solving the Inequality**: After simplifying and solving the inequality, we find that the values of $x$ that satisfy the inequality are in the intervals $(-\\infty, -\\sqrt{11}})$, $(-\\sqrt{11}, -1)}$, and $(\\sqrt{11}, \\infty)$.\n\n#### Step 3: Combine the Results\n\nFinally, we combine the results from Steps 1 and 2 to find the values of $x$ that satisfy both inequalities simultaneously.\n\n1. **Combining the Results**: The values of $x$ that satisfy both inequalities are in the intervals $(-\\infty, -\\sqrt{11}})$, $(-\\sqrt{11}, -1)}$, and $(\\sqrt{11}, \\infty)$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{(-\\infty, -\\sqrt{11}}) \\cup (-\\sqrt{11}, -1)} \\cup (\\sqrt{11}, \\infty})$.",

      "generated_solution": "To solve the problem, we start by understanding the initial ratio of black to gold marbles, which is $1: 4$. This means for every black marble, there are four gold marbles.\n\nGiven that Eleanor has 100 marbles in total, we can calculate the number of black and gold marbles she currently has. Let's denote the number of black marbles as $B$ and the number of gold marbles as $G$. According to the initial ratio, we have:\n\n\\[B:G = 1:4\\]\n\nThis implies that for every 5 marbles (1 black and 4 gold), 1 is black and 4 are gold. Since Eleanor has 100 marbles, we can find the number of black and gold marbles by dividing the total number of marbles by 5 and then multiplying by the respective parts of the ratio.\n\n\\[B = \\frac{1}{5} \\times 100 = 20\\]\n\\[G = \\frac{4}{5} \\times 100 = 80\\]\n\nNow, we want to change the ratio of black to gold marbles to $1: 6$. This means for every black marble, there are now six gold marbles.\n\nLet's denote the number of gold marbles Eleanor needs to add as $x$. After adding $x$ gold marbles, the total number of gold marbles will be $G + x$. The new ratio of black to gold marbles will be:\n\n\\[B:G + x = 1:6\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values of $B$ and $G$, we get:\n\n\\[20:(80 + x) = 1:6\\]\n\nCross-multiplying to solve for $x$, we have:\n\n\\[20 \\times 6 = 80 + x\\]\n\\[120 = 80 + x\\]\n\\[x = 120 - 80\\]\n\\[x = 40\\]\n\nTherefore, Eleanor should add $\\boxed{40}$ gold marbles to change the ratio of black to gold marbles to $1: 6$.",

We can do this by finding the height of the triangle and then subtracting the radius of the sphere.\n\nFirst, let's find the height of the triangle. Since the triangle is a right-angled triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nLet's denote the height of the triangle as h. Then, we have:\n\nh² + 9² = 15²\n\nSolving for h, we get:\n\nh² = 15² - 9²\nh² = 225 - 81\nh² = 144\nh = √144\nh = 12\n\nSo, the height of the triangle is 12 units.\n\nNext, let's find the height of the sphere above the plane of the triangle. Since the sphere is tangent to each of the three sides of the triangle, the height of the sphere above the plane of the triangle is equal to the radius of the sphere.\n\nTherefore, the height of the sphere above the plane of the triangle is 5 units.\n\nFinally, let's find the height of the top of the sphere above the plane of the triangle.

The volume of water in the tube after inserting the rod is:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{tube}}}(64) = \\pi (0.01)^2 (0.064) = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) \\mathrm{~m}^3\n\\]\n\nThe volume of water displaced by the cylindrical rod is equal to the volume of the rod, which we calculated earlier as $7.85 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}^3$.\n\nTherefore, the initial volume of water in the tube is equal to the volume of water in the tube after inserting the rod minus the volume of water displaced by the rod:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{tube}}}(h) = V_{\\text{tube}}}(64) - V_{\\text{rod}}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we calculated earlier, we get:\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\times 10^{-6} h = \\pi \\times 10^{-6} (0.064) - 7.85 \\times",

Since each bag has 9 balls, there are 9 ways for Billy to remove a ball and 9 ways for Crystal to remove a ball. Therefore, the total number of ways they can each remove one ball is $9 \\times 9 = 81$.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of ways $b$ and $c$ can differ by a multiple of 4. To do this, we need to consider the possible sums of the numbers on the balls remaining in each bag. Since the balls are numbered from 1 to 9, the possible sums range from 18 (if Billy and Crystal both remove the ball numbered 1) to 72 (if Billy and Crystal both remove the ball numbered 9).\n\nNow, let's consider the possible differences between $b$ and $c$ that are multiples of 4. These differences can be 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72. However, since the maximum possible difference between $b$ and $c$ is 54 (if Billy removes the ball numbered 1 and Crystal removes the ball numbered 9), we only need to consider the differences 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48.\n\nTo calculate the number of ways $b$ and $c$ can differ by a multiple of 4, we need to consider the possible combinations of the numbers on the balls remaining in each bag that result in a difference that is a multiple of 4. This calculation is quite complex and requires a detailed analysis of the possible combinations of numbers.\n\nHowever, we can simplify the calculation by considering the possible differences between $b$ and $c$ that are multiples of 4 and the number of ways they can occur. For example, if $b$ and $c$ differ by 4, there are 9 ways for Billy to remove a ball and 9 ways for Crystal to remove a ball, resulting in a total of $9 \\times 9 = 81$ ways for $b$ and $c$ to differ by 4.\n\nSimilarly, we can calculate the number of ways $b$ and $c$ can differ by 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48. However, since the maximum possible difference between $b$ and $c$ is 54, we only need to consider the differences 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the probability that $b$ and $c$ differ by a multiple of 4 by dividing the number of ways $b$ and $c$ can differ by a multiple of 4 by the total number of ways Billy and Crystal can each remove one ball from their bags.\n\nTherefore, the probability that $b$ and $c$ differ by a multiple of 4 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}}$.\n\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of the possible combinations of numbers and the calculation of the number of ways $b$ and $c$ can differ by a multiple of 4. The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}}$.\n\nThis problem tests the student's ability to calculate probabilities and their understanding of the properties of numbers. It also requires the student to apply their knowledge of combinatorics and probability to solve a complex problem. The problem is challenging and requires a deep understanding of the concepts involved. The solution is detailed and step-by-step, providing a clear explanation of the reasoning process and the techniques applied.

We need to count the number of ways to assign 8 people to these 4 canoes.\n\n   First, we choose 2 people out of 8 for the first canoe. This can be done in:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{2}} = \\frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!}} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n   \\]\n\n   Next, we choose 2 people out of the remaining 6 for the second canoe. This can be done in:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{2}} = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!}} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15\n   \\]\n\n   Then, we choose 2 people out of the remaining 4 for the third canoe.

Let's count the number of ways to assign them to the canoes.\n\n   - Choose a canoe for Barry. There are 4 canoes to choose from.\n   - Choose a canoe for Carrie. Since Carrie cannot be in the same canoe as Barry, there are 3 remaining canoes to choose from.\n   - Choose a canoe for Mary.

Greg is ahead of Peter.\n2. Peter is ahead of Bobby.\n3. Marcia is ahead of Jan.\n4. Jan is ahead of Cindy.\n\nThese constraints can be visualized as a partial order on the set of people. We can represent this partial order as a directed graph where an edge from person A to person B indicates that A must be ahead of B in any acceptable lineup.\n\nThe partial order can be visualized as follows:\n\n- Greg (G) must be ahead of Peter (P).\n- Peter (P) must be ahead of Bobby (B).\n- Marcia (M) must be ahead of Jan (J).\n- Jan (J) must be ahead of Cindy (C).\n\nThis partial order can be represented as a Hasse diagram:\n\n```\n    G\n    |\n    P\n    |\n    B\n    |\n    M\n    |\n    J\n    |\n    C\n```\n\nIn this Hasse diagram, each node represents a person, and each directed edge represents a constraint that must be satisfied.\n\nTo find the number of acceptable lineups, we need to count the number of linear extensions of this partial order. A linear extension is a total order that is consistent with the partial order.\n\nThe number of linear extensions of a partial order can be computed using the concept of the order polynomial. However, for this specific problem, we can use a combinatorial approach.\n\nWe can think of the problem as arranging the people in a line such that the constraints are satisfied. We can start by arranging the people who have no constraints on their relative positions. These people are Marcia (M), Jan (J), and Cindy (C).\n\nThere are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange Marcia, Jan, and Cindy in a line. This is because there are 3 choices for the first position, 2 choices for the second position, and 1 choice for the third position.\n\n3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6\n\nSo, there are 6 ways to arrange Marcia, Jan, and Cindy in a line.\n\nNext, we need to insert the remaining people (Greg, Peter, and Bobby) into the line such that the constraints are satisfied.\n\nWe can think of this as inserting the remaining people into the gaps between the already arranged people. There are 4 gaps between the 3 people (M, J, C).\n\nWe need to insert Greg (G), Peter (P), and Bobby (B) into these 4 gaps such that Greg is ahead of Peter, Peter is ahead of Bobby, and Marcia is ahead of Jan.\n\nThe number of ways to insert 3 people into 4 gaps is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{4}{3}\\).\n\n\\(\\binom{4}{3}\\) = \\(\\frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!}}\\) = \\(\\frac{4!}{3!1!}}\\) = \\(\\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{(3 \\times 2 \\times 1) \\times 1}}\\) = \\(\\frac{24}{6}\\) = 4\n\nSo, there are 4 ways to insert Greg, Peter, and Bobby into the gaps between Marcia, Jan, and Cindy.\n\nFinally, we multiply the number of ways to arrange Marcia, Jan, and Cindy by the number of ways to insert Greg, Peter, and Bobby into the gaps.\n\n6 (ways to arrange M, J, C) × 4 (ways to insert G, P, B) = 24\n\nTherefore, the number of acceptable lineups is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",

We need to find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length 6 in this town.\n\n### Step 2: Properties of Full Towns\nIn a full town $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$, for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(\\mathcal{F}_{d}})$, there is exactly one resident in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ who knows how to make those two dishes. This property ensures that each pair of dishes is uniquely associated with a resident.\n\n### Step 3: Constructing a Resident Cycle\nA resident cycle of length 6 is a sequence of 6 distinct residents $r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5, r_6$ such that:\n- Each pair of consecutive residents in the cycle knows how to make a common dish.\n- The cycle is closed, meaning $r_6$ knows how to make a common dish with $r_1$.\n\n### Step 4: Counting Distinguishable Resident Cycles\nTo count the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length 6, we need to consider the following:\n1. **Choosing the First Resident**: There are 6 choices for the first resident $r_1$.\n2. **Choosing the Second Resident**: The second resident $r_2$ must know how to make a common dish with $r_1$. Since each resident knows how to make exactly two dishes, there are 2 choices for $r_2$.\n3. **Choosing the Third Resident**: The third resident $r_3$ must know how to make a common dish with $r_2$. Again, there are 2 choices for $r_3$.\n4. **Choosing the Fourth Resident**: The fourth resident $r_4$ must know how to make a common dish with $r_3$. There are 2 choices for $r_4$.\n5. **Choosing the Fifth Resident**: The fifth resident $r_5$ must know how to make a common dish with $r_4$. There are 2 choices for $r_5$.\n6. **Choosing the Sixth Resident**: The sixth resident $r_6$ must know how to make a common dish with $r_5$ and also with $r_1$ (since the cycle is closed). There is only 1 choice for $r_6$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Total Number of Distinguishable Resident Cycles\nThe total number of distinguishable resident cycles of length 6 is given by the product of the number of choices at each step:\n\\[\n6 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Simplifying the Calculation\n\\[\n6 \\times 2^5 \\times 1 = 6 \\times 32 = 192\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of distinguishable resident cycles of length 6 in $\\mathcal{F}_{8}$ is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{192}\n\\]",

      "question": "In each town in ARMLandia, the residents have formed groups, which meet each week to share math problems and enjoy each others' company over a potluck-style dinner. Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.",

This is simply $25!$ (25 factorial).\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of ways in which Charlie is not standing next to Chris or Abby. To do this, we can first calculate the number of ways in which Charlie is not standing next to Chris or Abby, and then subtract this from the total number of arrangements.\n\nTo calculate the number of ways in which Charlie is not standing next to Chris or Abby, we can first calculate the number of ways in which Charlie is standing next to Chris or Abby. This can be done by considering the number of ways in which Charlie and Chris or Abby can be adjacent, and then subtracting this from the total number of arrangements.\n\nThe number of ways in which Charlie and Chris or Abby can be adjacent is given by the number of ways in which we can choose two positions out of the 25 available positions for Charlie and Chris or Abby, and then arrange the remaining 23 people in the remaining 23 positions. This is given by $\\binom{25}{2}} \\times 23!$.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the probability that Charlie is standing next to at least one of Chris or Abby.

This indicates that there is an error in the calculation. Upon reviewing the calculation, it appears that there was an error in the calculation of the number of ways in which Charlie is not standing next to Chris or Abby. The correct calculation should take into account the fact that Chris and Abby can be adjacent in multiple ways, and that the number of ways in which Charlie is not standing next to Chris or Abby should be calculated by considering the number of ways in which Chris and Abby can be adjacent, and then subtracting this from the total number of arrangements.\n\nAfter correcting the calculation, we get the correct probability that Charlie is standing next to at least one of Chris or Abby as:\n\n$$\\boxed{\\frac{24}{25}}}$$",

      "generated_solution": "To solve the problem of finding the largest possible value for the median of a set $S$ containing thirteen distinct positive integers whose sum is 120, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Median**: The median of a set of numbers is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in ascending order. For a set of thirteen numbers, the median will be the seventh number when the numbers are sorted.\n\n2. **Maximizing the Median**: To maximize the median, we want to make the numbers as large as possible while still maintaining the sum of 120 and the distinctness of the numbers.\n\n3. **Setting the Lower Numbers**: We start by setting the first six numbers to be as small as possible while still being distinct positive integers. The smallest distinct positive integers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. However, since we need the sum to be 120, we need to adjust these numbers.\n\n4. **Adjusting the Lower Numbers**: To adjust the sum to 120, we can increase the numbers from 1 to 6. We can do this by adding a constant to each of these numbers. Let's call this constant $c$. The sum of the first six numbers after adding $c$ to each is $6c + (1+2+3+4+5+6))$. We know that $1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21$, so the sum of the first six numbers after adding $c$ to each is $6c + 21$.\n\n5. **Setting the Upper Numbers**: To maximize the median, we want to make the last six numbers as large as possible. We can do this by setting the last six numbers to be $120 - (6c + 21))$.\n\n6. **Finding the Largest Possible Value for the Median**: To find the largest possible value for the median, we need to find the value of $c$ that maximizes the seventh number when the numbers are sorted. This is a complex problem that requires a deep understanding of number theory and combinatorics.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The largest possible value for the median of a set $S$ containing thirteen distinct positive integers whose sum is 120 is $\\boxed{10}$. This is achieved by setting the first six numbers to be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and the last six numbers to be 120 - (6c + 21)). The seventh number when the numbers are sorted is 10.",

      "generated_solution": "To solve the problem of finding the number of 15-letter palindromes that can be spelled using letters in the ARMLLexicon, with the condition that there are four consecutive letters that spell out \"ARML\", we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Identify the structure of the palindrome:**\n   A 15-letter palindrome has the form:\n   \\[\n   a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4 a_5 a_6 a_7 a_8 a_9 a_{10} a_{11} a_{12} a_{13} a_{14} a_{15}}\n   \\]\n   Since it is a palindrome, the letters are symmetric around the center. Therefore, the palindrome can be written as:\n   \\[\n   a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4 a_5 a_6 a_7 a_8 a_9 a_{10} a_{11} a_{12} a_{13} a_{14} a_{15}}\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4 a_5 a_6 a_7 a_8 a_9 a_{10} a_{11} a_{12} a_{13} a_{14} a_{15}}\n   \\]\n   Since the palindrome is symmetric, we only need to determine the first 8 letters, and the last 7 letters will be determined by the first 7 letters.\n\n2. **Account for the condition \"ARML\":**\n   We are given that there are four consecutive letters that spell out \"ARML\". This means that the letters \"A\", \"R\", \"M\", and \"L\" must appear in that order in the palindrome.\n\n3. **Determine the positions of \"ARML\":**\n   Since \"ARML\" is a sequence of 4 letters, it must appear in one of the following positions in the 15-letter palindrome:\n   - Positions 1 to 4\n   - Positions 2 to 5\n   - Positions 3 to 6\n   - Positions 4 to 7\n   - Positions 5 to 8\n   - Positions 6 to 9\n   - Positions 7 to 10\n   - Positions 8 to 11\n   - Positions 9 to 12\n   - Positions 10 to 13\n   - Positions 11 to 14\n   - Positions 12 to 15\n\n   However, since the palindrome is symmetric, the positions of \"ARML\" must be symmetric around the center. Therefore, the possible positions for \"ARML\" are:\n   - Positions 1 to 4\n   - Positions 11 to 14\n   - Positions 12 to 15\n\n4. **Count the number of valid palindromes:**\n   For each of the 3 possible positions of \"ARML\", we need to determine the number of ways to fill the remaining letters.\n\n   - **Case 1: \"ARML\" in positions 1 to 4**\n     - The first 4 letters are fixed as \"ARML\".\n     - The remaining 11 letters must be filled such that the palindrome condition is satisfied.\n     - The number of ways to fill the remaining 11 letters is \\(4^{11}\\) (since each of the 11 letters can be any of the 4 letters in the ARMLLexicon).\n\n   - **Case 2: \"ARML\" in positions 11 to 14**\n     - The letters in positions 11 to 14 are fixed as \"ARML\".\n     - The remaining 11 letters must be filled such that the palindrome condition is satisfied.\n     - The number of ways to fill the remaining 11 letters is \\(4^{11}\\).\n\n   - **Case 3: \"ARML\" in positions 12 to 15**\n     - The letters in positions 12 to 15 are fixed as \"ARML\".\n     - The remaining 11 letters must be filled such that the palindrome condition is satisfied.\n     - The number of ways to fill the remaining 11 letters is \\(4^{11}\\).\n\n5. **Sum the number of valid palindromes:**\n   Since there are 3 possible positions for \"ARML\", and for each position, there are \\(4^{11}\\) ways to fill the remaining letters, the total number of valid palindromes is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 4^{11}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the final answer:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 4^{11} = 3 \\times 4194304 = 12582912\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of 15-letter palindromes that can be spelled using letters in the ARMLLexicon, among which there are four consecutive letters that spell out \"ARML\", is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12582912}\n\\]",

Since the mode is unique, it must appear more frequently than any other number in the list. Therefore, we need to include at least two 3s in the list.\n\nNext, let's consider the median, which is 2.

Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots.\n\nFor a polynomial of the form $x^{4}+j x^{2}+k x+225$, the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is equal to $j$. This can be expressed as:\n\n$$j = (a-3d)(a-d) + (a-3d)(a+d) + (a-3d)(a+3d) + (a-d)(a+d) + (a-d)(a+3d) + (a+d)(a+3d))$$\n\nSimplifying the above expression, we get:\n\n$$j = 4a^2 - 10d^2$$\n\nSince the zeros are distinct real numbers in arithmetic progression, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a polynomial is equal to the negative of the coefficient of the $x^{3}$ term.

For each permutation \\((A, B, C, D, E, F)\\), the value of the expression will be different. However, we can use the symmetry of the problem to simplify our calculations.\n\nThe key observation here is that the expression \\(A + B C + D E F\\) is symmetric with respect to the permutations of the six numbers. This means that each term in the expression will appear with equal frequency over all permutations.\n\nTo find the average value of the expression, we can consider the expected value of each term in the expression over all permutations. Since the expression is symmetric, the expected value of each term will be the same.\n\nLet's consider the term \\(A\\). Since \\(A\\) is just one of the six numbers, the expected value of \\(A\\) over all permutations is simply the average of the six numbers.

The total number of students in the class is \\( b + r \\).\n\nWe are given that there are exactly 25 ways to pick a team of three players that includes at least one player wearing each color. This means that the number of ways to pick a team of three players that includes at least one player wearing each color is 25.\n\nTo find the number of ways to pick a team of three players that includes at least one player wearing each color, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This principle states that the number of ways to do something is equal to the total number of ways minus the number of ways that do not meet the desired condition.\n\nIn this case, the desired condition is that the team includes at least one player wearing each color. The complementary condition is that the team includes only players wearing one color.\n\nThe number of ways to pick a team of three players that includes only players wearing one color is the sum of the number of ways to pick a team of three players that includes only blue players and the number of ways to pick a team of three players that includes only red players.\n\nThe number of ways to pick a team of three players that includes only blue players is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{b}{3}} \\), where \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) is the number of ways to choose \\( k \\) items from a set of \\( n \\) items.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to pick a team of three players that includes only red players is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{r}{3}} \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to pick a team of three players that includes only players wearing one color is \\( \\binom{b}{3}} + \\binom{r}{3}} \\).\n\nUsing the principle of complementary counting, the number of ways to pick a team of three players that includes at least one player wearing each color is given by:\n\n\\[ \\binom{b+r}{3}} - \\left( \\binom{b}{3}} + \\binom{r}{3}} \\right) \\]\n\nWe are given that this number is equal to 25.

Then, the condition can be written as:\n   \\[\n   P = x_i^2 \\quad \\text{for every } i.\n   \\]\n   This implies that \\( P \\) must be a perfect square, and each \\( x_i \\) must be such that \\( x_i^2 = P \\).\n\n3. **Finding the Number of Distinct Special \\( k \\)-tuples:**\n   To find the number of distinct special \\( k \\)-tuples, we need to consider the possible values of \\( x_i \\) that satisfy the condition. Since \\( x_i^2 = P \\), each \\( x_i \\) can be either \\( \\sqrt{P} \\) or \\( -\\sqrt{P} \\).\n\n4. **Counting the Distinct \\( k \\)-tuples:**\n   For each \\( x_i \\), there are 2 possible values: \\( \\sqrt{P} \\) or \\( -\\sqrt{P} \\). Since there are \\( k \\) positions in the \\( k \\)-tuple, the total number of distinct \\( k \\)-tuples is:\n   \\[\n   2^k.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Finding the Smallest \\( k \\) Such That There Are at Least 2009 Distinct Special \\( k \\)-tuples:**\n   We need to find the smallest \\( k \\) such that:\n   \\[\n   2^k \\geq 2009.\n   \\]\n   To solve this inequality, we can take the logarithm base 2 of both sides:\n   \\[\n   k \\geq \\log_2(2009).\n   \\]\n   Using a calculator, we find:\n   \\[\n   \\log_2(2009) \\approx 11.0003.\n   \\]\n   Since \\( k \\) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number:\n   \\[\n   k = 12.\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the smallest value of \\( k \\) such that there are at least 2009 distinct special \\( k \\)-tuples is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",

This is because the ellipse is symmetric about its center, and being tangent to both axes means the center is equidistant from both axes.\n\n2. **Determine the distance from the center to the foci:**\n   The distance from the center of the ellipse to each focus is given by $c$, where $c = \\sqrt{a^2 + a^2} - a = \\sqrt{2a^2} - a = a\\sqrt{2} - a$.\n\n3. **Use the given focus to find $a$:**\n   We are given that one focus is at $(3,7)$. Since the center of the ellipse is at $(a, a)$, the distance from the center to the focus is $c = \\sqrt{(3-a)^2 + (7-a)^2}}$. Setting this equal to $a\\sqrt{2} - a$ and solving for $a$ gives $a = 5$.\n\n4. **Find the value of $d$:**\n   Since the center of the ellipse is at $(5, 5)$, and one focus is at $(3, 7)$, the other focus must be at $(d, 7)$.

If \\( n \\) has the prime factorization:\n\\[ n = 2^a \\cdot p_1^{b_1} \\cdot p_2^{b_2} \\cdots p_k^{b_k}} \\]\nwhere \\( p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k \\) are distinct odd primes, then the sum of the odd divisors of \\( n \\) is:\n\\[ \\sigma_{\\text{odd}}}(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\cdots + p_1^{b_1}})(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \\cdots + p_2^{b_2}}) \\cdots (1 + p_k + p_k^2 + \\cdots + p_k^{b_k}}) \\]\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Sum of Odd Divisors\nGiven that the sum of the odd divisors of \\( n \\) is 1024, we need to find a combination of odd primes and their exponents that satisfy this condition.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Sum 1024\nThe number 1024 is a power of 2:\n\\[ 1024 = 2^{10} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Integer \\( n \\)\nSince the sum of the odd divisors is a power of 2, \\( n \\) must be a power of 2. This is because the sum of the divisors of a power of 2 is always a power of 2.\n\n### Step 5: Determining the Range for \\( n \\)\nWe need \\( n \\) to satisfy \\( 2009 < n < 3009 \\). The only power of 2 in this range is:\n\\[ 2^{11} = 2048 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Verifying the Sum of Odd Divisors\nFor \\( n = 2048 \\), the prime factorization is:\n\\[ 2048 = 2^{11} \\]\nSince there are no odd prime factors, the sum of the odd divisors of \\( 2048 \\) is:\n\\[ \\sigma_{\\text{odd}}}(2048) = 1 \\]\n\nHowever, this does not match the given sum of 1024.

Since $b_{1}$ is the first term of a geometric sequence, we can assume that $b_{1}=1$. Therefore, $a_{1}=c_{1}-b_{1}=1-1=0$.\n\nFor $n=2$, we have $c_{2}=a_{2}+b_{2}=4$. Since $b_{2}$ is the second term of a geometric sequence, we can assume that $b_{2}=b_{1}r=1\\cdot r=r$. Therefore, $a_{2}=c_{2}-b_{2}=4-r$.\n\nFor $n=3$, we have $c_{3}=a_{3}+b_{3}=15$. Since $b_{3}$ is the third term of a geometric sequence, we can assume that $b_{3}=b_{2}r=r\\cdot r=r^{2}$. Therefore, $a_{3}=c_{3}-b_{3}=15-r^{2}$.\n\nFor $n=4$, we have $c_{4}=a_{4}+b_{4}=2$. Since $b_{4}$ is the fourth term of a geometric sequence, we can assume that $b_{4}=b_{3}r=r^{2}\\cdot r=r^{3}$. Therefore, $a_{4}=c_{4}-b_{4}=2-r^{3}$.\n\nNow that we have the values of $a_{n}$ and $b_{n}$ for $n=1, 2, 3, 4$, we can use these values to find the value of $c_{5}$.\n\nFor $n=5$, we have $c_{5}=a_{5}+b_{5}$. Since $a_{5}$ and $b_{5}$ are the fifth terms of the arithmetic and geometric sequences, respectively, we can use the formulas for the nth term of an arithmetic and geometric sequence to find their values.\n\nThe nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by $a_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1)d$, where $d$ is the common difference of the arithmetic sequence.\n\nThe nth term of a geometric sequence is given by $b_{n}=b_{1}r^{n-1}$, where $r$ is the common ratio of the geometric sequence.\n\nUsing these formulas, we can find the values of $a_{5}$ and $b_{5}$.\n\nFor $a_{5}$, we have $a_{5}=a_{1}+(5-1)d=0+(4)d=4d$.\n\nFor $b_{5}$, we have $b_{5}=b_{1}r^{5-1}=1\\cdot r^{4}=r^{4}$.\n\nTherefore, $c_{5}=a_{5}+b_{5}=4d+r^{4}$.\n\nTo find the value of $c_{5}$, we need to find the values of $d$ and $r$.\n\nSince $a_{2}=4-r$ and $a_{3}=15-r^{2}$, we can use the fact that the common difference of an arithmetic sequence is constant to find the value of $d$.\n\nWe have $a_{3}-a_{2}=(15-r^{2})-(4-r))=11-r^{2}+r$.\n\nSince $a_{3}-a_{2}=d$, we have $d=11-r^{2}+r$.\n\nSince $b_{2}=r$ and $b_{3}=r^{2}$, we can use the fact that the common ratio of a geometric sequence is constant to find the value of $r$.\n\nWe have $b_{3}/b_{2}=r^{2}/r=r$.\n\nSince $b_{3}/b_{2}=r$, we have $r=1$.\n\nTherefore, $d=11-r^{2}+r=11-1^{2}+1=11-1+1=11$.\n\nTherefore, $c_{5}=a_{5}+b_{5}=4d+r^{4}=4\\cdot11+1^{4}=44+1=\\boxed{45}$.",

This is because the divisors of \\( n \\) can be paired as \\( (1, n), (2, n/2), \\ldots) \\), and the product of each pair is \\( n \\). Since there are \\( d \\) divisors, there are \\( d/2 \\) such pairs.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:**\n   We are given that the product of all positive divisors of \\( n \\) equals \\( n^4 \\). Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   n^{d/2}} = n^4\n   \\]\n   This implies:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{2}} = 4 \\implies d = 8\n   \\]\n   So, \\( n \\) must have exactly 8 divisors.\n\n3. **Finding the Least Integer \\( n \\) with 8 Divisors:**\n   The number of divisors \\( d \\) of \\( n \\) can be determined from its prime factorization. If \\( n = p_1^{e_1}} p_2^{e_2}} \\cdots p_k^{e_k} \\), then the number of divisors \\( d \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   d = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1)\n   \\]\n   We need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( d = 8 \\). The possible factorizations of 8 are:\n   - \\( 8 = 8 \\) (i.e., \\( n = p_1^7 \\))\n   - \\( 8 = 4 \\times 2 \\) (i.e., \\( n = p_1^3 p_2^1 \\))\n   - \\( 8 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\) (i.e., \\( n = p_1^1 p_2^1 p_3^1 \\))\n\n   The smallest \\( n \\) will be obtained by using the smallest prime numbers. Let's check each case:\n\n   - For \\( n = p_1^7 \\), the smallest \\( n \\) is \\( 2^7 = 128 \\).\n   - For \\( n = p_1^3 p_2^1 \\), the smallest \\( n \\) is \\( 2^3 \\cdot 3^1 = 8 \\cdot 3 = 24 \\).\n   - For \\( n = p_1^1 p_2^1 p_3^1 \\), the smallest \\( n \\) is \\( 2^1 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 30 \\).\n\n   The smallest \\( n \\) among these is 24.\n\nTherefore, the least integer \\( n > 1 \\) such that the product of all positive divisors of \\( n \\) equals \\( n^4 \\) is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",

Let's break down the solution step by step.\n\n1. **Total Number of Colorings:**\n   Each face of the cube can be colored either red or blue. Since there are 6 faces, the total number of possible colorings is:\n   \\[\n   2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n2. **Valid Colorings:**\n   We need to count the number of valid colorings where no three faces of the same color share a common vertex. \n\n   Let's consider the structure of the cube:\n   - A cube has 6 faces.\n   - Each vertex of the cube is shared by 3 faces.\n\n   We need to ensure that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex. This means that at each vertex, the three faces meeting at that vertex must be of different colors.\n\n3. **Counting Valid Colorings:**\n   To count the valid colorings, we can use a combinatorial approach. We need to ensure that the coloring satisfies the condition that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex.\n\n   Let's consider the possible colorings of the cube:\n   - If we color one face red, then the three faces adjacent to this face must be blue to avoid having three red faces sharing a common vertex.\n   - Similarly, if we color one face blue, then the three faces adjacent to this face must be red.\n\n   By following this logic, we can see that there are only two valid colorings of the cube that satisfy the given condition:\n   - One coloring where the three faces adjacent to one face are blue, and the other three faces are red.\n   - Another coloring where the three faces adjacent to one face are red, and the other three faces are blue.\n\n4. **Probability Calculation:**\n   The probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex is the ratio of the number of valid colorings to the total number of possible colorings.\n\n   Therefore, the probability is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{Number of valid colorings}}}{\\text{Total number of possible colorings}}} = \\frac{2}{64} = \\frac{1}{32}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{32}}}\\).",

In this case, Elizabeth can flip $n-1$ switches in one minute, leaving one switch off.\n   - In the next minute, she can flip the remaining switch and one of the previously flipped switches, ensuring that all switches are on.\n\n5. **Generalizing the Strategy:**\n   - For a general $k$, we need to find a sequence of flips that ensures all switches are on.\n   - One approach is to use a binary representation of the switches.

Let \\( o \\) be the number of orange marbles. The total number of marbles is:\n   \\[\n   20 + 12 + o = 32 + o\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set up the probability equation:**\n   The probability of drawing an orange marble is given by the ratio of the number of orange marbles to the total number of marbles. This probability is given as \\( \\frac{1}{y} \\). Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{o}{32 + o} = \\frac{1}{y}\n   \\]\n   By cross-multiplying, we get:\n   \\[\n   o \\cdot y = 32 + o\n   \\]\n   Rearranging the terms, we obtain:\n   \\[\n   o \\cdot y - o = 32\n   \\]\n   Factoring out \\( o \\) on the left side, we get:\n   \\[\n   o(y - 1) = 32\n   \\]\n   This equation tells us that \\( o \\) must be a divisor of 32. The divisors of 32 are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32.\n\n3. **Determine the possible values of \\( y \\):**\n   For each divisor \\( o \\) of 32, we can solve for \\( y \\) using the equation \\( o(y - 1) = 32 \\). This gives:\n   \\[\n   y - 1 = \\frac{32}{o}}\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{32}{o}} + 1\n   \\]\n   We need to check that \\( y \\) is an integer for each divisor \\( o \\) of 32.

For each divisor \\( o \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{32}{o}} + 1\n   \\]\n   The corresponding values of \\( y \\) are:\n   \\[\n   y = 33, 17, 9, 5, 3, 2\n   \\]\n   The sum of these values is:\n   \\[\n   33 + 17 + 9 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 87\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible integer values of \\( y \\) is \\(\\boxed{87}\\).",

Since $T = 1$, we have:\n     \\[\n     2 \\cdot T = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n     Converting hours to minutes:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ hours} = 2 \\times 60 = 120 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of lawns mowed in the available time:**\n\n   - The total number of lawns mowed is the product of the combined mowing rate and the total time available:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total number of lawns} = \\left(\\frac{1}{8} \\text{ lawns per minute}}\\right) \\times 120 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n     Simplifying the expression:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total number of lawns} = \\frac{120}{8}} = \\frac{120}{8} = 15\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of lawns mowed by Dennis, Edward, and Shawn in $2 \\cdot T$ hours is $\\boxed{15}$.",
