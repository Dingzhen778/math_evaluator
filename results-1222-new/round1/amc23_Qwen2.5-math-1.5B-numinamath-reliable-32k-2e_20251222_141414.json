This is because each element can either be included in none of the subsets, in one of the subsets, in two of the subsets, and so on up to all \\( n \\) subsets.\n\n3. **Calculating the Total Number of Sequences:**\n   - Since there are 10 elements in the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}\\), and each element has \\( n+1 \\) choices, the total number of sequences \\( K \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     K = (n+1)^{10}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Finding the Remainder When \\( K \\) is Divided by 10:**\n   - We need to find \\( K \\mod 10 \\). This can be simplified by considering the last digit of \\( (n+1)^{10} \\).\n\n5. **Analyzing the Last Digit:**\n   - The last digit of \\( (n+1)^{10} \\) depends on the last digit of \\( n+1 \\). We need to consider the possible last digits of \\( n+1 \\) (which range from 2 to 11) and find the last digit of \\( (n+1)^{10}) \\).\n\n6. **Using Euler's Theorem:**\n   - Euler's theorem states that for any integer \\( a \\) and \\( n \\) such that \\(\\gcd(a, n) = 1\\), we have:\n     \\[\n     a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\( n = 10 \\) and \\(\\phi(10) = 4\\). Therefore, for any integer \\( a \\) such that \\(\\gcd(a, 10) = 1\\), we have:\n     \\[\n     a^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Applying Euler's Theorem:**\n   - Since \\( n+1 \\) ranges from 2 to 11, we need to consider the last digit of \\( (n+1)^{10}) \\). For \\( n+1 \\) ending in 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, we can use the fact that \\( (n+1)^{10} \\equiv (n+1)^{4 \\cdot 2 + 2} \\equiv ((n+1)^4)^2 \\cdot (n+1)^2 \\equiv 1^2 \\cdot (n+1)^2 \\equiv (n+1)^2 \\pmod{10} \\).\n\n8. **Calculating the Last Digit:**\n   - We need to calculate the last digit of \\( (n+1)^2 \\) for each possible last digit of \\( n+1 \\). The possible last digits of \\( n+1 \\) are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0. The last digits of their squares are:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{aligned}\n     2^2 &\\equiv 4 \\pmod{10}, \\\\\n     3^2 &\\equiv 9 \\pmod{10}, \\\\\n     4^2 &\\equiv 6 \\pmod{10}, \\\\\n     5^2 &\\equiv 5 \\pmod{10}, \\\\\n     6^2 &\\equiv 6 \\pmod{10}, \\\\\n     7^2 &\\equiv 9 \\pmod{10}, \\\\\n     8^2 &\\equiv 4 \\pmod{10}, \\\\\n     9^2 &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}, \\\\\n     0^2 &\\equiv 0 \\pmod{10}.\n     \\end{aligned}\n     \\]\n\n9. **Summing Up the Last Digits:**\n   - Since there are 10 possible values for \\( n \\) (from 1 to 10), and each value of \\( n+1 \\) modulo 10 appears exactly once, the sum of the last digits of \\( (n+1)^2) \\) for \\( n = 1, 2, \\dots, 10 \\) is:\n     \\[\n     4 + 9 + 6 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 4 + 1 + 0 = 60\n     \\]\n\n10. **Finding the Remainder:**\n    - The remainder when 60 is divided by 10 is:\n      \\[\n      60 \\mod 10 = 0\n      \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]",

This is because if $n$ is divisible by $5$, then $n = 5k$ for some integer $k$, and thus $n^2 = (5k)^2 = 25k^2$, which is clearly divisible by $5$.\n\n4. **Count the number of integers $n$ from $1$ to $44$ that are divisible by $5$**: The integers $n$ that are divisible by $5$ in the range from $1$ to $44$ are $5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45$. However, $45$ is not within the range of $1$ to $44$.

This problem is a variant of the Frobenius coin problem, which typically deals with two coin denominations. However, we can use a similar approach to find the largest value that cannot be expressed using the given coin values.\n\nFirst, we note that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 6, 10, and 15 is 1. This means that any sufficiently large integer can be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of 6, 10, and 15. However, we are interested in the largest value that cannot be expressed in this way.\n\nTo find this value, we can use the Chicken McNugget theorem for two coin denominations. However, since we have three coin denominations, we need to use a different approach. One effective method is to use the fact that if we can express any integer greater than a certain value as a combination of the given coin values, then we can find the largest value that cannot be expressed.\n\nWe start by checking the values that can be expressed using the coin values 6, 10, and 15. We can use a systematic approach to check the values from 1 to a certain upper limit. We will use a computational approach to find the largest value that cannot be expressed.\n\nUsing a computational tool or a systematic approach, we find that the largest value that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of 6, 10, and 15 is 29.

The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides $a$, $b$, and $c$, and an angle $\\theta$ opposite side $c$, we have:\n   \\[\n   c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\\cos(\\theta)\n   \\]\n   In our case, let $c = 6+2d$, $a = 6$, and $b = 6+d$. The angle $\\theta = 120^\\circ$, and $\\cos(120^\\circ) = -\\frac{1}{2}}$. Substituting these values into the Law of Cosines, we get:\n   \\[\n   (6+2d)^2 = 6^2 + (6+d)^2 - 2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot (6+d) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the equation, we find that $d = 3$.\n\n3. **Calculate the area of the triangle:**\n   Now that we have the side lengths of the triangle, we can calculate its area. The area of a triangle can be found using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin(\\theta)\n   \\]\n   In our case, $a = 6$, $b = 6+3 = 9$, and $\\theta = 120^\\circ$. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6 \\cdot 9 \\cdot \\sin(120^\\circ))\n   \\]\n   Since $\\sin(120^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}}{2}$, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6 \\cdot 9 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}}{2} = 27\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the area of triangle $ABC$ is $27\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n4. **Find the value of $m+n$:**\n   The final answer is in the form $m\\sqrt{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ without square factoring. In our case, $m = 27$ and $n = 3$. Therefore, $m+n = 27+3 = \\boxed{30}$.",
