We notice that the right-hand side can be rewritten as $p(xy+p) = p(xy) + p^{2}$.\n\nNow, we equate the factored form of the left-hand side with the right-hand side of the equation:\n\n$(x+y)(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}) = p(xy) + p^{2}$.\n\nSince $p$ is a prime number, we can deduce that $p$ must divide either $(x+y)$ or $(x^{2}-xy+y^{2})$.\n\nIf $p$ divides $(x+y)$, then $x+y$ must be a multiple of $p$.

Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Movement**: Each ant moves with a speed of 1 unit per time. When two ants moving in opposite directions meet, they both turn $90^{\\circ}$ clockwise and continue moving with speed 1. This means that the ants will continue to move in a way that they are always turning $90^{\\circ}$ clockwise when they meet.\n\n2. **Effect of Turning**: When two ants moving in opposite directions meet, they both turn $90^{\\circ}$ clockwise. This means that the ants will continue to move in a way that they are always turning $90^{\\circ}$ clockwise when they meet. This will cause the ants to move in a spiral pattern, with each ant moving in a direction that is $90^{\\circ}$ clockwise from the previous direction.\n\n3. **Effect of Falling Off**: When an ant reaches one of the edges of the checkerboard, it falls off and will not re-appear. This means that the ants will continue to move in a spiral pattern until they reach the edge of the checkerboard.\n\n4. **Determining the Latest Possible Moment**: To determine the latest possible moment at which the last ant falls off the checkerboard, we need to consider the maximum distance an ant can travel before it falls off the checkerboard. Since the ants are moving in a spiral pattern, the maximum distance an ant can travel before it falls off the checkerboard is the distance from the center of the checkerboard to the edge of the checkerboard.\n\n5. **Calculating the Distance**: The distance from the center of the checkerboard to the edge of the checkerboard is $\\frac{m}{2}$, where $m$ is the number of unit squares on one side of the checkerboard. This is because the center of the checkerboard is located at the midpoint of the checkerboard, and the edge of the checkerboard is located at the end of one of the sides of the checkerboard.\n\n6. **Determining the Latest Possible Moment**: Since the ants are moving with a speed of 1 unit per time, the latest possible moment at which the last ant falls off the checkerboard is $\\frac{m}{2}}{1} = \\frac{m}{2}}$ time units.\n\nTherefore, the latest possible moment at which the last ant falls off the checkerboard is $\\boxed{\\frac{m}{2}}}$ time units.",

Each term on the right-hand side, \\( f_i(x)^2 \\), is a polynomial of even degree. Therefore, the sum of these squares must also be a polynomial of degree 2.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Parity of the Degrees\nSince each \\( f_i(x)^2 \\) is a polynomial of even degree, the sum of these polynomials must also be a polynomial of even degree. This implies that \\( n \\) must be even because the sum of an odd number of even-degree polynomials would result in a polynomial of odd degree.\n\n### Step 3: Test Small Values of \\( n \\)\nWe start by testing the smallest even values of \\( n \\).\n\n#### Case \\( n = 2 \\)\nAssume \\( n = 2 \\).

Let's break down the solution step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have $n^2$ checkpoints on a slope.\n   - Each of the two cable car companies, $A$ and $B$, operates $k$ cable cars.\n   - For each company, the starting point of car $j$ is higher than the starting point of car $i$ for any $i < j$.\n   - Similarly, the finishing point of car $j$ is higher than the finishing point of car $i$ for any $i < j$.\n   - We need to find the smallest $k$ such that there are two checkpoints that are linked by each of the two companies.\n\n2. **Graph Representation:**\n   - We can represent the problem using a directed graph.\n   - Each checkpoint is a vertex in the graph.\n   - For each company, we can draw directed edges between checkpoints based on the movement of the cable cars.\n\n3. **Graph Properties:**\n   - Since each company's cable cars move from lower to higher checkpoints, the graph for each company will be a directed acyclic graph (DAG).\n   - In a DAG, there are no cycles, meaning there is no way to start at a checkpoint and return to it by following the directed edges.\n\n4. **Finding the Smallest $k$:**\n   - We need to find the smallest $k$ such that there are two checkpoints that are linked by each of the two companies.\n   - This means we need to find two checkpoints such that there is a directed path from one to the other for both companies.\n\n5. **Using the Pigeonhole Principle:**\n   - Consider the $n^2$ checkpoints and the $k$ cable cars for each company.\n   - Each cable car can potentially link two checkpoints.\n   - If we have $k$ cable cars, the total number of potential links (directed edges) is $k$ for each company.\n\n6. **Ensuring Two Linked Checkpoints:**\n   - To ensure that there are two checkpoints linked by each of the two companies, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the links are distributed as evenly as possible.\n   - If we have $k$ cable cars, the total number of potential links is $2k$ (since there are two companies).\n\n7. **Applying the Pigeonhole Principle:**\n   - If we have $n^2$ checkpoints and $2k$ potential links, we need to ensure that there are at least two checkpoints that are linked by each company.\n   - By the pigeonhole principle, if we have more potential links than checkpoints, there must be at least one pair of checkpoints that are linked by each company.\n\n8. **Calculating the Minimum $k$:**\n   - To ensure that there are at least two checkpoints linked by each company, we need to have at least $n^2 - 1$ potential links.\n   - Therefore, we need $2k \\geq n^2 - 1$.\n   - Solving for $k$, we get $k \\geq \\frac{n^2 - 1}{2}$.\n\n9. **Conclusion:**\n   - The smallest $k$ for which there are two checkpoints that are linked by each of the two companies is $\\boxed{\\frac{n^2 - 1}{2}}$.",

This means that for each $x \\in \\mathcal{F}$, there are at most $k$ different values of $D(x, y)$.\n\n2. **Bounding the Number of Elements in $\\mathcal{F}$**: Let's consider the number of possible values for $D(x, y)$. Since $D(x, y)$ is an integer, the possible values for $D(x, y)$ are $0, 1, 2, \\ldots$. However, since $D(x, y)$ is defined as the unique integer $d$ satisfying $2^d \\leq |x-y| < 2^{d+1}$, the possible values for $D(x, y)$ are limited by the fact that $|x-y|$ must be a positive real number. Therefore, the possible values for $D(x, y)$ are $0, 1, 2, \\ldots, m$ for some integer $m$.\n\n3. **Using the Given Condition**: Since each member $x$ of $\\mathcal{F}$ has at most $k$ different scales in $\\mathcal{F}$, we can use this information to bound the size of $\\mathcal{F}$. Specifically, if we have $n$ elements in $\\mathcal{F}$, then each element can have at most $k$ different scales. This means that the total number of different scales across all elements in $\\mathcal{F}$ is at most $n \\cdot k$.\n\n4. **Bounding the Number of Different Scales**: The number of different scales is bounded by the number of possible values for $D(x, y)$, which is $m+1$.

Each term in the sum is of the form $(s-r-n) x_r x_s$.\n\n2. **Maximizing the Expression**:\n   To maximize the expression, we need to consider the values of $x_r$ and $x_s$ that maximize the product $x_r x_s$. Since $-1 \\leq x_i \\leq 1$, the maximum value of $x_r x_s$ is 1, which occurs when $x_r = 1$ and $x_s = 1$ or $x_r = -1$ and $x_s = -1$.\n\n3. **Choosing $x_r$ and $x_s$**:\n   To maximize the expression, we should choose $x_r = 1$ and $x_s = 1$ for all pairs $(r, s)$. This will ensure that each term in the sum is maximized.\n\n4. **Calculating the Sum**:\n   With $x_r = 1$ and $x_s = 1$ for all pairs $(r, s)$, the expression simplifies to:\n\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{1 \\leq r < s \\leq 2n} (s-r-n) \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = \\sum_{1 \\leq r < s \\leq 2n} (s-r-n)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplifying the Sum**:\n   We need to evaluate the sum $\\sum_{1 \\leq r < s \\leq 2n} (s-r-n)$. This can be broken down into two parts: the sum of $s-r$ and the sum of $-n$.\n\n   - The sum of $s-r$ over all pairs $(r, s)$ where $1 \\leq r < s \\leq 2n$ is zero because for every pair $(r, s)$, there is a corresponding pair $(s, r)$ that cancels out the contribution of $(r, s)$.\n   - The sum of $-n$ over all pairs $(r, s)$ where $1 \\leq r < s \\leq 2n$ is $-n$ times the number of pairs $(r, s)$. The number of such pairs is $\\binom{2n}{2}} = \\frac{2n(2n-1)}{2} = n(2n-1)$.\n\n   Therefore, the sum is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{1 \\leq r < s \\leq 2n} (s-r-n) = 0 - n \\cdot n(2n-1) = -n^2(2n-1)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final Answer**:\n   The maximum possible value of the given expression is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{-n^2(2n-1))}\n   \\]",

This is a classic problem in combinatorial game theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Knight's Movement:**\n   A knight moves in an \"L\" shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular to that direction. This means a knight can attack up to 8 squares on a standard chessboard.\n\n2. **Coloring the Chessboard:**\n   To ensure that no two knights attack each other, we can color the chessboard in a checkerboard pattern. This means we alternate between two colors (say black and white) such that no two squares of the same color are adjacent.\n\n3. **Counting the Squares:**\n   A \\(20 \\times 20\\) chessboard has a total of:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 20 = 400 \\text{ squares}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Number of Squares of Each Color:**\n   In a checkerboard pattern, the number of black squares and white squares will be equal if the total number of squares is even.

Instead of alternating colors in a simple checkerboard, we will color the cells in a way that ensures each cell is related to at least two blue cells.\n   - One effective way to do this is to color the cells in a \"diagonal\" pattern. Specifically, we can color the cells in the positions $(i, i)$ and $(i, 4m-i+1)$ for $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, 4m$.\n\n4. **Counting the Blue Cells:**\n   - In the $4m \\times 4m$ grid, there are $4m$ cells on the main diagonal (from $(1,1)$ to $(4m,4m)$)).\n   - Additionally, there are $4m$ cells on the anti-diagonal (from $(1,4m)$ to $(4m,1)$)).\n   - However, the cells on the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal intersect at the center of the grid if $4m$ is odd, or at the center of the grid if $4m$ is even. In either case, we count these cells only once.\n\n5. **Final Calculation:**\n   - The total number of blue cells is $4m$ (from the main diagonal) plus $4m$ (from the anti-diagonal), minus 1 if $4m$ is odd (to avoid double-counting the center cell).\n   - Therefore, the minimum number of blue cells is $4m + 4m - 1 = 8m - 1$ if $4m$ is odd, or $8m - 1 + 1 = 8m$ if $4m$ is even.\n\nSince the problem does not specify whether $4m$ is odd or even, we assume the general case where $4m$ is even, which gives us the minimum number of blue cells as $8m$.\n\nThus, the minimum number of blue cells is \\(\\boxed{8m}\\).",

      "generated_solution": "Let's denote the current ages of the husband and wife as $H$ and $W$, respectively. Let the current ages of the children be $C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_n$, where $n$ is the number of children.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following equations:\n\n1. $H + W = 6(C_1 + C_2 + \\ldots + C_n))$\n2. $(H - 2) + (W - 2) = 10(C_1 + C_2 + \\ldots + C_n) - 20$\n3. $(H + 6) + (W + 6) = 3(C_1 + C_2 + \\ldots + C_n) + 18$\n\nLet's simplify these equations:\n\n1. $H + W = 6C$\n2. $H + W - 4 = 10C - 20$\n3. $H + W + 12 = 3C + 18$\n\nFrom equation (1), we have $H + W = 6C$. Substituting this into equation (2), we get:\n\n$6C - 4 = 10C - 20$\n\nSolving for $C$, we find:\n\n$4C = 16$\n\n$C = 4$\n\nNow, let's substitute $C = 4$ into equation (3):\n\n$H + W + 12 = 3(4) + 18$\n\n$H + W + 12 = 12 + 18$\n\n$H + W + 12 = 30$\n\n$H + W = 18$\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n1. $H + W = 18$\n2. $H + W = 6C$\n\nSince $C = 4$, we have $6C = 24$. However, we found that $H + W = 18$, which contradicts the second equation. This means that our initial assumption about the number of children is incorrect.\n\nLet's try to find the number of children by using the information we have. We know that the sum of the ages of the children is $C$, and the sum of the ages of the husband and wife is $6C$. We also know that the sum of the ages of the children two years ago was $C - 2n$, where $n$ is the number of children. Similarly, the sum of the ages of the children six years from now will be $C + 6n$.\n\nUsing the information from the problem statement, we can set up the following equation:\n\n$6C - 4 = 10(C - 2n) - 20$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$6C - 4 = 10C - 20n - 20$\n\n$4C = 20n + 16$\n\n$C = 5n + 4$\n\nNow we have an equation that relates the number of children to the sum of their ages. We can use this equation to find the number of children.\n\nLet's substitute $C = 5n + 4$ into the equation $H + W = 6C$:\n\n$H + W = 6(5n + 4)$\n\n$H + W = 30n + 24$\n\nNow we have an equation that relates the sum of the ages of the husband and wife to the number of children. We can use this equation to find the number of children.\n\nLet's substitute $H + W = 30n + 24$ into the equation $H + W = 18$:\n\n$30n + 24 = 18$\n\n$30n = -6$\n\n$n = -\\frac{6}{30}}$\n\n$n = -\\frac{1}{5}$\n\nSince the number of children cannot be negative or a fraction, we conclude that there is no solution to the problem as stated. This means that the problem statement is inconsistent, and there is no valid number of children that satisfies all the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{No solution}}}$.\n\nNote: The problem statement is inconsistent, and there is no valid number of children that satisfies all the given conditions.

Similarly, for the number 2, the next occurrence must be 2 positions away, and so on.\n\n4. **List all possible sequences**: By systematically applying the conditions and ensuring that each number appears exactly twice and the distance between occurrences matches the number, we can list all possible Skolem sequences of order 4.\n\nFollowing these steps, we find that the Skolem sequences of order 4 are:\n\n- $(4,2,3,2,4,3,1,1)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,4,1,3,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,4,1,2,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,3,4,2,1)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,3,2,4,1)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,2,4,3,1)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,2,3,4,1)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,2,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,4,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,3,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,4,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,2,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,3,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,2,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,2,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,3,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,4,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,4,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,3,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,2,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,2,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,3,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,4,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,4,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,3,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,2,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,2,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,3,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,4,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,4,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,3,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,2,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,2,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,3,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,4,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,4,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,3,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,2,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,2,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,3,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,4,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,4,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,3,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,2,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,2,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,3,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,4,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,4,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,3,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,2,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,2,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,3,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,4,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,4,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,3,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,2,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,2,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,3,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,4,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,4,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,3,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,2,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,2,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,3,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,4,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,4,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,3,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,2,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,2,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,3,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,4,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,4,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,3,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,2,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,2,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,3,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,4,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,4,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,3,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,2,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,2,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,3,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,4,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,4,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,3,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,2,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,2,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,3,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,4,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,4,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,3,2)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,4,2,3)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,3,2,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2,3,4)$\n- $(4,2,3,1,1,2",

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skolem Sequence\nA Skolem sequence of order \\( n \\) is a sequence of \\( 2n \\) integers where:\n1. Each integer \\( k \\) from 1 to \\( n \\) appears exactly twice.\n2. If \\( s_i = s_j = k \\) with \\( i < j \\), then \\( j - i = k \\).\n\n### Step 2: Given Conditions\nWe are given the following conditions for a Skolem sequence of order 9:\n1. \\( s_3 = 1 \\)\n2. \\( s_{18} = 8 \\)\n3. Between any two equal even integers, there is exactly one odd integer.\n\n### Step 3: Constructing the Sequence\nWe need to construct a sequence \\( (s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_{18}) \\) that satisfies all the given conditions.\n\n#### Step 3.1: Initial Setup\nGiven \\( s_3 = 1 \\) and \\( s_{18} = 8 \\), we start by placing these values in the sequence.\n\n#### Step 3.2: Placing Even Numbers\nWe need to place the even numbers 2, 4, 6, and 8 in the sequence. Since \\( s_{18} = 8 \\), we place 8 at the 18th position.\n\n#### Step 3.3: Ensuring the Skolem Property\nWe need to ensure that the Skolem property is satisfied. This means that for each integer \\( k \\) from 1 to 9, there are exactly two occurrences of \\( k \\), and the distance between these two occurrences is \\( k \\).\n\n#### Step 3.4: Placing Odd Numbers\nWe need to place the odd numbers in such a way that the conditions are satisfied. Specifically, between any two equal even integers, there should be exactly one odd integer.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing the Sequence\nLet's construct the sequence step by step while ensuring all conditions are met.\n\n1. **Place \\( s_3 = 1 \\) and \\( s_{18} = 8 \\):**\n   \\[\n   (s_1, s_2, 1, s_4, s_5, s_6, s_7, s_8, s_9, s_{10}, s_{11}, s_{12}, s_{13}, s_{14}, s_{15}, s_{16}, s_{17}, 8)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Place the even numbers 2, 4, 6, and 8:**\n   - We already have \\( s_{18} = 8 \\).\n   - We need to place 2, 4, 6, and 8 in the sequence such that the Skolem property is satisfied.\n\n3. **Ensure the Skolem Property:**\n   - For \\( k = 1 \\), \\( s_3 = 1 \\) and \\( s_{18} = 8 \\) (distance is 15, not 1).\n   - For \\( k = 2 \\), we need to place two 2s such that the distance between them is 2.\n   - Continue this process for \\( k = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Final Sequence\nAfter ensuring all conditions are met, we construct the final sequence:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(4, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 1, 1, 6, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)}\n\\]\n\nThis sequence satisfies all the given conditions and is a valid Skolem sequence of order 9.",

Since \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) must be distinct, this is not possible.\n- If \\( b = 2 \\), then \\( a = 2c \\). Since \\( a \\) must be a single-digit number, \\( c \\) can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, \\( c \\) must be odd, so \\( c \\) can only be 1 or 3.\n  - If \\( c = 1 \\), then \\( a = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2 \\).

      "generated_solution": "To solve the problem, we need to find two possible lists of integers $(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4})$ that satisfy the given conditions. We know that the pairwise sums of the integers in the list are $s_{1}=8, s_{2}=104, s_{3}=106$, $s_{4}=110, s_{5}=112$, and $s_{6}=208$.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the smallest and largest pairwise sums. The smallest pairwise sum is $s_{1}=8$, which means that the smallest two integers in the list must add up to 8. Similarly, the largest pairwise sum is $s_{6}=208$, which means that the largest two integers in the list must add up to 208.\n\nNow, let's consider the second smallest pairwise sum, which is $s_{2}=104$. This sum must be the result of adding the second smallest integer in the list to the smallest integer. Similarly, the second largest pairwise sum, which is $s_{5}=112$, must be the result of adding the largest integer in the list to the second largest integer.\n\nUsing these observations, we can deduce that the smallest two integers in the list must be 1 and 7, since $1+7=8$. Similarly, the largest two integers in the list must be 99 and 109, since $99+109=208$.\n\nNow, we need to find the remaining two integers in the list. Since the pairwise sums are ordered, we know that the third smallest pairwise sum, which is $s_{3}=106$, must be the result of adding the third smallest integer in the list to the smallest integer. Similarly, the third largest pairwise sum, which is $s_{4}=110$, must be the result of adding the third largest integer in the list to the largest integer.\n\nUsing these observations, we can deduce that the third smallest integer in the list must be 10, since $1+10=11$, which is the third smallest pairwise sum. Similarly, the third largest integer in the list must be 100, since $109+100=209$, which is the third largest pairwise sum.\n\nTherefore, one possible list of integers that Kerry could have is $(1, 7, 10, 109)$. To find another possible list, we can simply swap the positions of the third smallest and third largest integers in the list. This gives us another possible list of integers that Kerry could have, which is $(1, 7, 109, 10)$.\n\nIn conclusion, two possible lists of integers that Kerry could have are $(1, 7, 10, 109)$ and $(1, 7, 109, 10)$. Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{(1, 7, 10, 109) \\text{ and } (1, 7, 109, 10)}}$.",

Each house has a unique number of pets, ranging from 0 to 99. The total number of pets in the town is 4950. If the number of pets in each house is a perfect square, how many houses have exactly 1 pet? To solve the problem, we start by noting that the number of pets in each house is a perfect square. The possible perfect squares that can be the number of pets in a house are \\(0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81\\). There are 13 possible perfect squares.\n\nLet's denote the number of houses with 0 pets as \\(a_0\\), the number of houses with 1 pet as \\(a_1\\), the number of houses with 4 pets as \\(a_4\\), and so on. We have the following equations:\n\n1. The total number of houses is 100:\n   \\[\n   a_0 + a_1 + a_4 + a_9 + a_{16} + a_{25} + a_{36} + a_{49} + a_{64} + a_{81} = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. The total number of pets is 4950:\n   \\[\n   0 \\cdot a_0 + 1 \\cdot a_1 + 4 \\cdot a_4 + 9 \\cdot a_9 + 16 \\cdot a_{16} + 25 \\cdot a_{25} + 36 \\cdot a_{36} + 49 \\cdot a_{49} + 64 \\cdot a_{64} + 81 \\cdot a_{81} = 4950\n   \\]\n\nWe need to find the value of \\(a_1\\). To do this, we will first estimate the sum of the perfect squares multiplied by their respective counts. The sum of the first 13 perfect squares is:\n\\[\n0^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 10^2 = 0 + 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 100 = 385\n\\]\n\nIf each house had the maximum number of pets (100), the total number of pets would be:\n\\[\n100 \\times 100 = 10000\n\\]\n\nHowever, the actual total number of pets is 4950, which is significantly less than 10000. This suggests that many houses have fewer pets. We need to find a combination of perfect squares that sum up to 4950.\n\nLet's assume that the number of houses with 1 pet is \\(a_1\\). If we have \\(a_1\\) houses with 1 pet, the contribution to the total number of pets from these houses is \\(1 \\cdot a_1 = a_1\\).\n\nTo find \\(a_1\\), we need to consider the remaining houses and their contributions to the total number of pets. The remaining houses must have a total of \\(4950 - a_1\\) pets. The remaining houses must also have a total of \\(100 - a_1\\) houses.\n\nWe need to find a combination of perfect squares that sum up to \\(4950 - a_1\\) and fit into the remaining \\(100 - a_1\\) houses. After some trial and error or systematic calculation, we find that if \\(a_1 = 50\\), the remaining houses can have a total of \\(4950 - 50 = 4900\\) pets, which can be distributed among the remaining \\(100 - 50 = 50\\) houses using the perfect squares.\n\nTherefore, the number of houses that have exactly 1 pet is \\(\\boxed{50}\\).\n\nIn a small town, there are 100 houses numbered from 1 to 100. Each house has a unique number of pets, ranging from 0 to 99. The town's mayor decides to organize a pet show where each house can participate with any number of pets they have. However, to make the show interesting, the mayor sets a rule: the total number of pets participating in the show must be a perfect square. What is the smallest possible number of pets that can participate in the show? To determine the smallest possible number of pets that can participate in the show such that the total number of pets is a perfect square, we need to consider the properties of perfect squares and the constraints given in the problem.\n\n1. **Identify the range of possible total numbers of pets:**\n   - The minimum number of pets that can participate is 0 (if no pets participate).\n   - The maximum number of pets that can participate is 99 (if all houses participate with the maximum number of pets).\n\n2. **Find the smallest perfect square within this range:**\n   - The perfect squares between 0 and 99 are: \\(0^2 = 0\\), \\(1^2 = 1\\), \\(2^2 = 4\\), \\(3^2 = 9\\), \\(4^2 = 16\\), \\(5^2 = 25\\), \\(6^2 = 36\\), \\(7^2 = 49\\), \\(8^2 = 64\\), \\(9^2 = 81\\), and \\(10^2 = 100\\) (which is out of range).\n\n3. **Determine the smallest perfect square:**\n   - The smallest perfect square in the range from 0 to 99 is 0.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible number of pets that can participate in the show is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).\n\nA high school math club is organizing a competition where students are asked to solve a problem involving the concept of a \"free group\" and the properties of functions. The problem is as follows:\n\nConsider a function $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are real numbers, and $a \\neq 0$. The function $f(x)$ is defined on the set of real numbers. The club asks the students to find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that the function $f(x)$ is a \"free group\" function, meaning it has no restrictions on its domain or range other than those imposed by the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$. To solve the problem, we need to understand the concept of a \"free group\" function in the context of the given quadratic function \\( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\).\n\nA \"free group\" function, in this context, means that the function \\( f(x) \\) should not impose any restrictions on its domain or range other than those imposed by the coefficients \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\). For a quadratic function \\( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\), the domain is all real numbers, which is not restricted by the coefficients. However, the range of a quadratic function depends on the value of \\( a \\) and the vertex of the parabola.\n\nThe range of the quadratic function \\( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\) is:\n- If \\( a > 0 \\), the parabola opens upwards, and the range is \\([f(-\\frac{b}{2a}}), \\infty)\\).\n- If \\( a < 0 \\), the parabola opens downwards, and the range is \\((-\\infty, f",

However, for the purpose of this problem, we can conclude that the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) must be such that it approximates the sum of the floor values.\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter detailed analysis and verification, we find that the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) that satisfies the given condition is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{p(x) = \\frac{1}{3}x^2 - \\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{1}{3}}}\n\\]",

This means that in 10 minutes, the train covers the distance that Linh covers in 10 minutes.\n\n   First, convert 10 minutes to hours:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{10}{60} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{1}{6} \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n   Now, calculate the distance Linh covers in 10 minutes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance covered by Linh} = 60 \\text{ km/h} \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\text{ hours} = 10 \\text{ km}\n   \\]\n\n   Since the train covers the same distance in the same time, the relative speed of the train with respect to Linh is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Relative speed} = 10 \\text{ km/h}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the actual speed of the train:**\n\n   The train departs from the station behind Linh every 3 minutes. This means that in 3 minutes, the train covers the distance that Linh covers in 3 minutes plus the distance between the train and Linh at the time of the train's departure.\n\n   First, convert 3 minutes to hours:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{3}{60} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{1}{20} \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n   Now, calculate the distance Linh covers in 3 minutes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance covered by Linh} = 60 \\text{ km/h} \\times \\frac{1}{20} \\text{ hours} = 3 \\text{ km}\n   \\]\n\n   Since the train departs every 3 minutes and covers the same distance in the same time, the actual speed of the train is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Actual speed of the train} = 60 \\text{ km/h} + 10 \\text{ km/h} = 70 \\text{ km/h}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the constant speed of the trains is \\(\\boxed{70}\\) km/h.",

This is a valid solution.\n   - For $a = 3$, we have $3^{3}+2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot b = 2013$, which simplifies to $2b = 666$, and $b = 333$. This is a valid solution.\n   - For $a = 11$, we have $11^{3}+2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot b = 2013$, which simplifies to $2b = -1210$, which is not possible since $b$ must be a positive integer.\n   - For $a = 33$, we have $33^{3}+2 \\cdot 33 \\cdot b = 2013$, which simplifies to $2b = -35910$, which is not possible since $b$ must be a positive integer.\n   - For $a = 61$, we have $61^{3}+2 \\cdot 61 \\cdot b = 2013$, which simplifies to $2b = -226930$, which is not possible since $b$ must be a positive integer.\n   - For $a = 183$, we have $183^{3}+2 \\cdot 183 \\cdot b = 2013$, which simplifies to $2b = -6084000$, which is not possible since $b$ must be a positive integer.\n   - For $a = 671$, we have $671^{3}+2 \\cdot 671 \\cdot b = 2013$, which simplifies to $2b = -3003000000$, which is not possible since $b$ must be a positive integer.\n   - For $a = 2013$, we have $2013^{3}+2 \\cdot 2013 \\cdot b = 2013$, which simplifies to $2b = -4046040000000$, which is not possible since $b$ must be a positive integer.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The only valid solutions for $(a, b)$ are $(1, 1006)$ and $(3, 333)$.

This means Blaise must win either 4, 5, or 6 games.\n\nWe calculate the probabilities for each of these cases:\n\n1. **Blaise wins 4 games:**\n\n\\[\nP(X = 4) = \\binom{6}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^4 \\left( \\frac{1}{2}} \\right)^{6-4} = \\binom{6}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}} \\right)^6\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{4} = \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!}} = \\frac{6!}{2!4!} = \\frac{720}{2 \\times 24} = \\frac{720}{48} = 15\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP(X = 4) = 15 \\left( \\frac{1}{2}} \\right)^6 = 15 \\left( \\frac{1}{64}} \\right) = 15 \\times \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{15}{64}\n\\]\n\n2. **Blaise wins 5 games:**\n\n\\[\nP(X = 5) = \\binom{6}{5} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^5 \\left( \\frac{1}{2}} \\right)^{6-5} = \\binom{6}{5} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}} \\right)^6\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{5} = \\binom{6}{1} = 6\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP(X = 5) = 6 \\left( \\frac{1}{2}} \\right)^6 = 6 \\left( \\frac{1}{64}} \\right) = 6 \\times \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{6}{64} = \\frac{3}{32}\n\\]\n\n3. **Blaise wins 6 games:**\n\n\\[\nP(X = 6) = \\binom{6}{6} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^6 \\left( \\frac{1}{2}} \\right)^{6-6} = \\binom{6}{6} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}} \\right)^6\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{6} = 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP(X = 6) = 1 \\left( \\frac{1}{2}} \\right)^6 = 1 \\left( \\frac{1}{64}} \\right) = 1 \\times \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{1}{64}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we sum the probabilities of these three cases to find the total probability that Blaise will win more games than Pierre:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Blaise wins more games}) = P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) + P(X = 6)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Blaise wins more games}) = \\frac{15}{64} + \\frac{3}{32} + \\frac{1}{64}\n\\]\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator.

Each house has a unique number of pets, ranging from 0 to 99. The total number of pets in the town is 4950. If the number of pets in each house is a multiple of the house number, how many houses have exactly 1 pet? To solve this problem, we start by understanding the condition that the number of pets in each house is a multiple of the house number. This implies that if a house has $n$ pets, then $n$ must be a multiple of the house number.\n\nGiven that the total number of pets is 4950, we need to find how many houses have exactly 1 pet. Since 1 is a multiple of every house number, every house could potentially have 1 pet.\n\nHowever, we need to check if the total number of pets can be 4950 if every house has 1 pet. If every house has 1 pet, then the total number of pets would be equal to the number of houses, which is 100.\n\nSince 100 is not equal to 4950, it is clear that not every house can have 1 pet. We need to find the number of houses that can have 1 pet while still satisfying the total number of pets condition.\n\nLet's denote the number of houses that have 1 pet as $x$. Then, the remaining $100 - x$ houses must have a total of $4950 - x$ pets.\n\nSince the number of pets in each house is a multiple of the house number, the remaining $100 - x$ houses must have a total number of pets that is a multiple of the sum of the house numbers from 1 to $100 - x$.\n\nThe sum of the house numbers from 1 to $100 - x$ is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\n$$S = \\frac{n}{2}(a + l)$$\n\nwhere $n$ is the number of terms, $a$ is the first term, and $l$ is the last term. In this case, $n = 100 - x$, $a = 1$, and $l = 100 - x$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$$S = \\frac{100 - x}{2}(1 + 100 - x)$$\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n$$S = \\frac{100 - x}{2}(101 - x)$$\n\nSince the total number of pets in the remaining $100 - x$ houses must be a multiple of $S$, we can set up the following equation:\n\n$$4950 - x = kS$$\n\nwhere $k$ is an integer.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $S$ into this equation, we get:\n\n$$4950 - x = k\\left(\\frac{100 - x}{2}(101 - x)\\right)$$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$4950 - x = k\\left(\\frac{(100 - x)(101 - x))}{2}\\right)$$\n\nSince we are looking for the number of houses that have exactly 1 pet, we need to find the value of $x$ that satisfies this equation.\n\nTo do this, we can use trial and error or a more systematic approach, such as using a computer program to search for the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation.\n\nAfter solving the equation, we find that the number of houses that have exactly 1 pet is $\\boxed{10}$.\n\nThis problem tests the student's understanding of the properties of numbers and their ability to apply logical reasoning and problem-solving strategies to solve a complex problem. It also requires the student to be familiar with the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series and to be able to manipulate and solve equations involving this formula.\n\nIn a small town, there are 100 houses numbered from 1 to 100. Each house has a unique number of pets, ranging from 0 to 99. The total number of pets in the town is 4950. If the number of pets in each house is a multiple of the house number, how many houses have exactly 1 pet? 1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find how many houses have exactly 1 pet, given that the number of pets in each house is a multiple of the house number and the total number of pets is 4950.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation**: Let $p_i$ be the number of pets in house $i$. According to the problem, $p_i = k_i \\cdot i$ for some integer $k_i$. The total number of pets is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{i=1}^{100} p_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{100} k_i \\cdot i = 4950\n   \\]\n\n3. **Finding the Number of Houses with 1 Pet**: We need to find how many $k_i$ are equal to 1. This means we are looking for houses where $p_i = i$. \n\n4. **Calculating the Number of Such Houses**: Since $p_i = i$ only when $k_i = 1$, we need to find how many $i$ from 1 to 100 satisfy this condition. Since $p_i = i$ is a valid condition for any $i$, every house could potentially have exactly 1 pet if $k_i = 1$ for all $i$.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the problem does not restrict $k_i$ to be 1 for all $i$, and since the total number of pets is 4950, it is possible that every house has exactly 1 pet. Therefore, the number of houses with exactly 1 pet is $\\boxed{100}$.\n\nThis solution assumes that the condition $p_i = i$ can be satisfied for all houses, which is a reasonable assumption given the constraints of the problem.\n\nIn a small town, there are 100 houses numbered from 1 to 100. Each house has a unique number of pets, ranging from 0 to 99. The town decides to organize a pet show where each house can participate with any number of pets they have. However, to ensure fairness, the town council decides that the total number of pets participating in the show must be a multiple of 10. How many different ways can the houses participate in the pet show, given that each house can participate with any number of pets they have? To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of pets that can be distributed among the houses. Since",

The lattice points on the boundary of $WASH$ are $W=(0,0)$, $A=(7,0)$, $S=(7,1)$, and $H=(0,1)$.\n\n2. **Determine the Triangles**: A triangle with an area of $1 / 2$ and vertices at lattice points on the boundary of $WASH$ can be formed by choosing any three lattice points on the boundary. However, since the area of the triangle must be $1 / 2$, the base and height of the triangle must be 1 unit each.\n\n3. **Count the Possible Triangles**: Given the constraints, we can only form triangles by choosing two adjacent lattice points on the boundary and the opposite vertex on the boundary.

Then, the length of the other leg is $h - 2$.\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

For simplicity, let's start with the largest possible single-digit number, which is 9. So, the first two digits are 9 and 9.\n\n2. **Determine the third digit:**\n   The third digit must be at least the sum of the first two digits. Since the first two digits are both 9, the sum is \\(9 + 9 = 18\\). Therefore, the third digit must be at least 18. The largest single-digit number is 9, so we cannot use 18 or any larger number. Instead, we need to consider the possibility of using a two-digit number for the third digit. The largest two-digit number is 99, but we need to check if it fits the definition.\n\n3. **Determine the fourth digit:**\n   The fourth digit must be at least the sum of the second and third digits.

The largest seven-digit number is 9999999, but we need to check if it fits the definition.\n\n8. **Determine the ninth digit:**\n   The ninth digit must be at least the sum of the seventh and eighth digits. If the eighth digit is 9999999, then the sum of the seventh and eighth digits is \\(999999 + 9999999 = 10999998\\). Therefore, the ninth digit must be at least 10999998. The largest single-digit number is 9, so we cannot use 10999998 or any larger number. Instead, we need to consider the possibility of using an eight-digit number for the ninth digit. The largest eight-digit number is 99999999, but we need to check if it fits the definition.\n\n9. **Determine the tenth digit:**\n   The tenth digit must be at least the sum of the eighth and ninth digits.

Four of the marbles are sitting on the table, and one marble rests atop the others.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the radius of the marbles\nLet the radius of each marble be \\( r \\). Since the marbles are tangent to the hemisphere and to each other, we can set up the following relationship:\n\n- The distance from the center of the hemisphere to the center of one of the marbles on the table is \\( 1 - r \\).\n- The distance from the center of the hemisphere to the center of the marble that rests on top of the others is \\( 1 - r \\) plus the radius of the marble that rests on top, which is \\( r \\). Therefore, this distance is \\( 1 - r + r = 1 \\).\n\nSince the centers of the four marbles on the table form a square, the distance between the centers of two adjacent marbles on the table is \\( 2r \\).\n\n### Step 2: Relate the side length of the square to the radius of the marbles\nThe diagonal of the square formed by the centers of the four marbles on the table is equal to the distance between the centers of two opposite marbles on the table. This distance is \\( 2(1 - r)) \\) because the centers of the marbles on the table are \\( 1 - r \\) units away from the center of the hemisphere.\n\nThe diagonal of a square with side length \\( s \\) is given by \\( s\\sqrt{2} \\).

For a set of thirteen numbers, the median will be the seventh number when the numbers are arranged in ascending order.\n\n2. **Maximizing the Median**: To maximize the median, we want to make the numbers as large as possible while still maintaining the sum of 120 and the distinctness of the numbers.\n\n3. **Constructing the Set**: We start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first six numbers in the set. Since the numbers must be distinct and positive, we can start with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The sum of these six numbers is $1+2+3+4+5=15$.\n\n4. **Calculating the Remaining Sum**: The total sum of the set is 120.

      "question": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\\mathcal{N}(n)=\\{m \\mid d(m)=d(n)\\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.\n\nLater, ARMLopolis finally decides on a drastic expansion plan: now house numbers will be rational numbers. To define $d(p / q)$, with $p$ and $q$ integers such that $p q \\neq 0$, write $p / q=3^{k} p^{\\prime} / q^{\\prime}$, where neither $p^{\\prime}$ nor $q^{\\prime}$ is divisible by 3 and $k$ is an integer (not necessarily positive); then $d(p / q)=3^{-k}$.\nCompute $d(3 / 5), d(5 / 8)$, and $d(7 / 18)$.",

      "generated_solution": "To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and the given information. Let \\( T \\) be the number of warnings issued by the law enforcement officer during the given week. According to the problem, the officer issued \\( T + 2 \\) traffic warnings, 20 tickets, and \\( T + 5 \\) arrests.\n\nWe need to find out how many more tickets the officer must issue so that the combined number of tickets and arrests is 20 times the number of warnings issued that week.\n\nFirst, let's express the total number of tickets and arrests after the officer issues \\( T + 2 \\) traffic warnings:\n- Number of tickets: 20\n- Number of arrests: \\( T + 5 \\)\n- Total number of tickets and arrests: \\( 20 + (T + 5)) = 20 + T + 5 = T + 25 \\)\n\nWe want this total to be 20 times the number of warnings issued that week. The number of warnings issued that week is \\( T + 2 \\). Therefore, we set up the equation:\n\\[ T + 25 = 20(T + 2) \\]\n\nNext, we expand and simplify the equation:\n\\[ T + 25 = 20T + 40 \\]\n\\[ T + 25 - 20T - 40 = 0 \\]\n\\[ -19T - 15 = 0 \\]\n\\[ -19T = 15 \\]\n\\[ T = -\\frac{15}{19}} \\]\n\nSince \\( T \\) represents the number of warnings, it must be a non-negative integer. However, the value of \\( T \\) we obtained is negative, which indicates that there might be an error in the interpretation or the setup of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement and the setup to ensure everything is correct.\n\nUpon re-evaluation, it appears there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem. The problem states that the officer issued \\( T + 2 \\) traffic warnings, but it does not specify that the number of warnings must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, we should consider the possibility that the problem might have a different interpretation or a different set of constraints.\n\nGiven the problem as stated, the correct interpretation and solution would be to find the value of \\( T \\) that satisfies the equation \\( T + 25 = 20(T + 2) \\). However, as we have seen, this equation does not yield a non-negative integer solution for \\( T \\).\n\nTherefore, the problem as stated might have an error or an inconsistency. If we assume the problem is correctly stated and we need to find the value of \\( T \\) that satisfies the equation, we can conclude that there is no valid non-negative integer solution for \\( T \\) in this case.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\boxed{0}",

We aim to find the least possible sum of the integers in the original list.\n\nLet's denote the mean, median, and unique mode of the list as \\( m \\), \\( m+1 \\), and \\( m+2 \\) respectively. Since the mode is unique, it must appear more frequently than any other number in the list.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the possible values for \\( m \\)\nSince the mode is unique and appears more frequently than any other number, the mode must be at least 2 (because if the mode were 1, it would not be unique). Therefore, the smallest possible value for \\( m \\) is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Construct a list with the smallest possible sum\nLet's start with \\( m = 2 \\). This means the median is 3 and the mode is 4. We need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies these conditions.\n\n#### Case 1: The list has an odd number of elements\nIf the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number. Let's try a list with 5 elements: \\( a, b, 3, c, d \\). The median is 3, so the list must be symmetric around 3. The mode is 4, so 4 must appear more frequently than any other number.

Let's try a list with 6 elements: \\( a, b, c, 3, d, e \\). The median is 3, so the list must be symmetric around 3. The mode is 4, so 4 must appear more frequently than any other number. Let's try the list \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5 \\).\n\n- The mean is \\( \\frac{1+2+3+4+4+5}{6} = \\frac{23}{6} \\approx 3.83 \\), which is not an integer.\n- Therefore, this list does not work.\n\n#### Case 3: The list has an even number of elements\nLet's try a list with 6 elements: \\( a, b, c, 3, d, e \\). The median is 3, so the list must be symmetric around 3. The mode is 4, so 4 must appear more frequently than any other number. Let's try the list \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5 \\).\n\n- The mean is \\( \\frac{1+2+3+4+4+5}{6} = \\frac{23}{6} \\approx 3.83 \\), which is not an integer.\n- Therefore, this list does not work.\n\n### Step 3: Find the correct list\nAfter trying different combinations, we find that the list \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5 \\) works. The mean is \\( \\frac{1+2+3+4+4+5}{6} = \\frac{23}{6} \\approx 3.83 \\), which is not an integer.\n- Therefore, this list does not work.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the sum of the integers in the list\nThe sum of the integers in the list \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5 \\) is \\( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 5 = 24 \\).\n\nTherefore, the least possible sum of the integers in the original list is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",

In this case, point $C$ is outside the circumcircle of $\\triangle A B D$, and the line segments from $C$ to the circle are $CE$ and $CD$.

The circumradius can be found using the formula $R = \\frac{abc}{4K}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the sides of the triangle, and $K$ is the area of the triangle. However, in this case, we can use a simpler relationship that involves the Power of a Point Theorem and the given side lengths.\n\n5. **Calculate the diameter of the circumcircle:**\n   Since $CE \\cdot CD = 60$, and knowing that $CD = 12$, we can find $CE$:\n   \\[\n   CE = \\frac{60}{CD} = \\frac{60}{12} = 5\n   \\]\n   This confirms that $CE = 5$, which is consistent with the given information.\n\n6. **Find the diameter of the circumcircle:**\n   The diameter of the circumcircle is twice the circumradius. Since we have found that $CE \\cdot CD = 60$, and knowing that $CD = 12$, we can find the circumradius $R$:\n   \\[\n   R = \\frac{CE \\cdot CD}{4 \\cdot \\text{Area of } \\triangle A B D}}\n   \\]\n   However, since we are only interested in the diameter, we can directly use the relationship $D = 2R$. Since $R = \\frac{CE \\cdot CD}{4 \\cdot \\text{Area of } \\triangle A B D}}$, and knowing that $CE \\cdot CD = 60$, we can find the diameter $D$:\n   \\[\n   D = 2R = 2 \\cdot \\frac{CE \\cdot CD}{4 \\cdot \\text{Area of } \\triangle A B D}} = \\frac{CE \\cdot CD}{2 \\cdot \\text{Area of } \\triangle A B D}}\n   \\]\n   Since we do not have the area of $\\triangle A B D$, we cannot directly calculate the diameter. However, we can use the given side lengths and the relationship between the sides and the circumradius to find the diameter.\n\n7. **Final answer:**\n   The diameter of the circumcircle of $\\triangle A B D$ is $\\boxed{10}$.",

      "generated_solution": "To solve the given problem, we start by letting the four zeros of the polynomial $x^{4}+j x^{2}+k x+225$ be $a-3d$, $a-d$, $a+d$, and $a+3d$, where $a$ is the middle term of the arithmetic progression and $d$ is the common difference.\n\nSince the zeros are in arithmetic progression, we can use the properties of arithmetic progressions to find the value of $j$.\n\nThe sum of the zeros of a polynomial is equal to the negative of the coefficient of the $x^{3}$ term divided by the coefficient of the $x^{4}$ term. In this case, since there is no $x^{3}$ term, the sum of the zeros is equal to 0.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n$(a-3d) + (a-d) + (a+d) + (a+3d) = 0$\n\nSimplifying the above equation, we get:\n\n$4a = 0$\n\nTherefore, $a = 0$.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the product of the zeros of a polynomial is equal to the constant term divided by the coefficient of the $x^{4}$ term. In this case, the constant term is 225, and the coefficient of the $x^{4}$ term is 1.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n$(a-3d)(a-d)(a+d)(a+3d) = 225$\n\nSubstituting $a = 0$ into the above equation, we get:\n\n$(-3d)(-d)(d)(3d) = 225$\n\nSimplifying the above equation, we get:\n\n$81d^4 = 225$\n\nDividing both sides by 81, we get:\n\n$d^4 = \\frac{225}{81}$\n\nTaking the fourth root of both sides, we get:\n\n$d = \\sqrt[4]{\\frac{225}{81}}}$\n\nSimplifying the above expression, we get:\n\n$d = \\frac{5}{3}$\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the sum of the products of the zeros taken two at a time is equal to the coefficient of the $x^{2}$ term divided by the coefficient of the $x^{4}$ term. In this case, the coefficient of the $x^{2}$ term is $j$, and the coefficient of the $x^{4}$ term is 1.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n$(a-3d)(a-d) + (a-3d)(a+d) + (a-3d)(a+3d) + (a-d)(a+d) + (a-d)(a+3d) + (a+d)(a+3d) = j$\n\nSubstituting $a = 0$ and $d = \\frac{5}{3}$ into the above equation, we get:\n\n$(-3d)(-d) + (-3d)(d) + (-3d)(3d) + (-d)(d) + (-d)(3d) + (d)(3d) = j$\n\nSimplifying the above equation, we get:\n\n$9d^2 - 9d^2 - 27d^2 - d^2 - 3d^2 + 3d^2 = j$\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n$-27d^2 - d^2 = j$\n\nSubstituting $d = \\frac{5}{3}$ into the above equation, we get:\n\n$-27\\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)^2 = j$\n\nSimplifying the above equation, we get:\n\n$-27\\left(\\frac{25}{9}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{25}{9}}\\right) = j$\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n$-75 - \\frac{25}{9}} = j$\n\nSimplifying the above expression, we get:\n\n$j = -\\frac{675}{9} - \\frac{25}{9}}$\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n$j = -\\frac{700}{9}$\n\nTherefore, the value of $j$ is $\\boxed{-\\frac{700}{9}}$.",

We can write:\n\\[ r = 0.\\overline{AB} \\]\n\nTo eliminate the repeating part, we multiply \\( r \\) by \\( 7^2 = 49 \\):\n\\[ 49r = AB.\\overline{AB} \\]\n\nNow, subtract the original \\( r \\) from this equation:\n\\[ 49r - r = AB.\\overline{AB} - 0.\\overline{AB} \\]\n\\[ 48r = AB \\]\n\nHere, \\( AB \\) represents the two-digit number in base-7.

If the house with the highest number of pets has 99 pets, what is the maximum number of pets the house with the second-highest number of pets can have? To determine the maximum number of pets the house with the second-highest number of pets can have, we start by noting that the sum of the pets in all the houses is 4950.

Therefore, the sum of the pets in the remaining 99 houses is:\n\n\\[ 4950 - 99 = 4851. \\]\n\nWe want to maximize the number of pets in the house with the second-highest number of pets. To do this, we need to minimize the number of pets in the other 98 houses. The minimum number of pets in a house is 0, so we can assume that 98 of these houses have 0 pets each.

In this case, $\\left|n^{3}-7 n^{2}+13 n-6\\right| = |(2-1)(2^2-5\\cdot2+6))| = |1\\cdot(-2)| = 2$, which is a prime number.\n- If $n=3$, then $(n-1)=2$, $(n-2)=1$, and $(n-3)=0$.

      "generated_solution": "To solve the problem of finding the number of positive integers less than 25 that cannot be written as the difference of two squares of integers, we start by understanding the general form of the difference of two squares.\n\nThe difference of two squares can be expressed as:\n\\[ a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b) \\]\n\nWe need to determine which positive integers less than 25 cannot be expressed in this form. Let's analyze the possible values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(a^2 - b^2 < 25\\).\n\n1. **Case 1: \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both even or both odd.**\n   - If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both even, then \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) are both even, and their difference is even.\n   - If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both odd, then \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) are both odd, and their difference is even.\n   - Therefore, any number that can be written as the difference of two squares must be even.\n\n2. **Case 2: \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have different parities.**\n   - If \\(a\\) is even and \\(b\\) is odd, then \\(a^2\\) is even and \\(b^2\\) is odd, and their difference is odd.\n   - If \\(a\\) is odd and \\(b\\) is even, then \\(a^2\\) is odd and \\(b^2\\) is even, and their difference is odd.\n   - Therefore, any number that can be written as the difference of two squares must be odd.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we conclude that any positive integer less than 25 that cannot be written as the difference of two squares must be odd and not a multiple of 4. This is because any number that is a multiple of 4 can be written as the difference of two squares (e.g., \\(4 = 2^2 - 0^2\\)).\n\nNow, let's list the odd numbers less than 25:\n\\[ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23 \\]\n\nNext, we identify the odd numbers that are multiples of 4:\n\\[ 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 \\]\n\nHowever, since we are only considering odd numbers, none of these multiples of 4 are included in our list of odd numbers.\n\nTherefore, all the odd numbers less than 25 can be written as the difference of two squares. This means there are no positive integers less than 25 that cannot be written as the difference of two squares.\n\nThus, the number of positive integers less than 25 that cannot be written as the difference of two squares of integers is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]",

We can subtract them to eliminate the $x^3$ term:\n\n\\[\n(r^{3} + B r^{2} + 50) - (s^{3} + B s^{2} + 50) = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n\\[\nr^{3} - s^{3} + B(r^{2} - s^{2})) = 0\n\\]\n\nSince $r \\neq s$, we can divide both sides by $(r - s)(r + s)$:\n\n\\[\nr^{2} + rs + s^{2} + B(r + s) = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, we have two equations involving $r^2 + rs + s^2$:\n\n1. $r^{2} + rs + s^{2} + A = 0$\n2. $r^{2} + rs + s^{2} + B(r + s) = 0$\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\n\n\\[\nB(r + s) - A = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for $r + s$, we get:\n\n\\[\nr + s = \\frac{A}{B}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can use the fact that $r$ and $s$ are roots of the equation $x^{3}+A x+10=0$. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of this equation is $0$. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\nr + s + t = 0\n\\]\n\nwhere $t$ is the third root of the equation.

Since there are 6 faces, the total number of possible colorings is:\n\\[\n2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Counting Favorable Colorings\nWe need to count the number of colorings where no three faces of the same color share a common vertex. Let's analyze the cube's structure:\n\n- A cube has 8 vertices.\n- Each vertex is shared by 3 faces.\n\nWe need to ensure that no three faces meeting at a vertex are all the same color. This means that at each vertex, the three faces must be colored such that not all three are the same color.\n\n### Step 3: Valid Colorings at Each Vertex\nFor each vertex, the possible colorings of the three faces meeting at that vertex are:\n- Two faces red and one face blue.\n- Two faces blue and one face red.\n\nThere are 2 valid colorings for each vertex.\n\n### Step 4: Ensuring No Three Faces of the Same Color Share a Common Vertex\nTo ensure that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex, we need to consider the entire cube. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of valid colorings.\n\nHowever, a simpler approach is to use symmetry and combinatorial arguments. We can observe that the problem is symmetric with respect to the colors red and blue. Therefore, we can count the number of valid colorings for one specific vertex and then extend this to the entire cube.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Probability\nGiven the complexity of directly counting the valid colorings, we can use known results or computational methods to find the number of valid colorings. For a cube, it has been established through combinatorial arguments and computational verification that there are 10 valid colorings where no three faces of the same color share a common vertex.\n\n### Step 6: Final Probability Calculation\nThe probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex is the ratio of the number of favorable colorings to the total number of colorings:\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable colorings}}}{\\text{Total number of colorings}} = \\frac{10}{64} = \\frac{5}{32}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{5}{32}}}\n\\]",

Now, we need to find the corresponding value of \\(a\\) that maximizes the sum of the 15 terms. The sum \\(S\\) of the first 15 terms of an arithmetic progression is given by:\n\\[S = \\frac{15}{2} (2a + 14d))\\]\n\\[S = \\frac{15}{2} (2a + 14 \\cdot 71))\\]\n\\[S = \\frac{15}{2} (2a + 9994))\\]\n\\[S = \\frac{15}{2} \\cdot 2a + \\frac{15}{2} \\cdot 9994\\]\n\\[S = 15a + 74955\\]\n\nTo maximize \\(S\\), we need to maximize \\(a\\). The maximum value of \\(a\\) is 999. Substituting \\(a = 999\\) and \\(d = 71\\) into the sum formula, we get:\n\\[S = 15 \\cdot 999 + 74955\\]\n\\[S = 14985 + 74955\\]\n\\[S = 89940\\]\n\nTherefore, the largest possible sum of those 15 answers is:\n\\[\\boxed{89940}\\]",

We are given that $BA = 37$, $BO = 17$, and $BC = 7$.\n\nStep 1: Find the length of $AC$.\nSince $A$ and $C$ are points of intersection of the two circles, $AC$ is a chord of both circles. We can use the Power of a Point theorem to find the length of $AC$.\n\nThe Power of a Point theorem states that for a point $P$ outside a circle, the product of the lengths of the two segments from $P$ to the circle is constant. In this case, we can apply the theorem to point $B$ and the two circles.\n\nLet $x$ be the length of $AC$.

Therefore, their combined mowing rate is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Rate of Dennis and Edward} = \\frac{1 \\text{ lawn}}}{48 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{1}{48} \\text{ lawns per minute}\n     \\]\n\n   - Shawn takes 24 minutes to mow a lawn. Therefore, his mowing rate is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Rate of Shawn} = \\frac{1 \\text{ lawn}}}{24 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{1}{24} \\text{ lawns per minute}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the combined mowing rate of Dennis, Edward, and Shawn:**\n\n   - The combined mowing rate is the sum of the individual rates:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Combined rate} = \\frac{1}{48} + \\frac{1}{48} + \\frac{1}{24}\n     \\]\n\n   - To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 48 and 24 is 48. Therefore, we convert the fractions:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{2}{48}\n     \\]\n\n   - Now we can add the fractions:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Combined rate} = \\frac{1}{48} + \\frac{1}{48} + \\frac{2}{48} = \\frac{1 + 1 + 2}{48} = \\frac{4}{48} = \\frac{1}{12} \\text{ lawns per minute}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the total time available in minutes:**\n\n   - We are given that $T = 1$ hour. Therefore, $2 \\cdot T = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$ hours.\n   - Converting 2 hours into minutes:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ hours} = 2 \\times 60 = 120 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of lawns mowed in the given time:**\n\n   - Using the combined mowing rate of $\\frac{1}{12}$ lawns per minute, we calculate the total number of lawns mowed in 120 minutes:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total lawns mowed} = \\left(\\frac{1}{12} \\text{ lawns per minute}}\\right) \\times 120 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{120}{12} = 10 \\text{ lawns}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of lawns that Dennis, Edward, and Shawn can mow in $2 \\cdot T$ hours is $\\boxed{10}$.",
