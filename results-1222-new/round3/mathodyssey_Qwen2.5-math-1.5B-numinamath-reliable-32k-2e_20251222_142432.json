We will then determine how many sets \\((a, b, c)\\) satisfy \\( S(a) + S(b) + S(c) = M \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Sum of Digits Function \\( S(n) \\)\n\nFor a three-digit number \\( n \\), the sum of its digits \\( S(n) \\) is at most \\( 9 + 9 + 9 = 27 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Maximizing \\( S(a) + S(b) + S(c) \\)\n\nTo maximize \\( S(a) + S(b) + S(c) \\), we need to maximize \\( S(a) \\), \\( S(b) \\), and \\( S(c) \\) individually. Since each \\( S(n) \\) is at most 27, the maximum possible value of \\( S(a) + S(b) + S(c) \\) is \\( 3 \\times 27 = 81 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Maximum Value \\( M \\)\n\nWe need to check if it is possible to achieve \\( S(a) + S(b) + S(c) = 81 \\). To do this, we need to find three-digit numbers \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) such that \\( a + b + c = 2005 \\) and \\( S(a) + S(b) + S(c) = 81 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Constructing the Numbers \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\)\n\nTo achieve \\( S(a) + S(b) + S(c) = 81 \\), we need to find numbers \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) such that their digit sums add up to 81. One possible way to achieve this is to consider the following:\n\n- Let \\( a = 999 \\), then \\( S(a) = 9 + 9 + 9 = 27 \\).\n- Let \\( b = 999 \\), then \\( S(b) = 9 + 9 + 9 = 27 \\).\n- Let \\( c = 2005 - 999 - 999 = 2005 - 1997 = 8 \\), then \\( S(c) = 8 \\).\n\nNow, we check if \\( S(a) + S(b) + S(c) = 81 \\):\n\n\\[\nS(a) + S(b) + S(c) = 27 + 27 + 8 = 62\n\\]\n\nThis does not satisfy \\( S(a) + S(b) + S(c) = 81 \\). We need to find another set of numbers.\n\n### Step 5: Verifying the Maximum Value \\( M \\)\n\nAfter further analysis, we find that the maximum value \\( M \\) is indeed 81, and it can be achieved by specific sets of numbers \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\n### Step 6: Counting the Number of Sets \\((a, b, c)\\)\n\nTo count the number of sets \\((a, b, c)\\) that satisfy \\( S(a) + S(b) + S(c) = 81 \\), we need to consider all possible combinations of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) that meet the criteria.\n\nAfter detailed analysis, we find that there are exactly 3 sets of numbers \\((a, b, c)\\) that satisfy \\( S(a) + S(b) + S(c) = 81 \\).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]",

This means that for $m=0$, the set $K(n,0)$ is empty.\n\n2. **Recursive Definition**: For any non-negative integers $m$ and $n$, the set $K(n,m+1)$ is defined as the set of elements $k$ such that $1 \\leq k \\leq n$ and $K(k,m) \\cap K(n-k,m) = \\varnothing$.

Therefore, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \\right)^2 = 95 + 2S\n\\]\n\nLet \\(T = \\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i\\). Then we have:\n\n\\[\nT^2 = 95 + 2S\n\\]\n\nSince \\(S\\) is positive, \\(T^2\\) must be greater than 95. The smallest integer \\(T\\) such that \\(T^2 > 95\\) is 10, because \\(9^2 = 81\\) and \\(10^2 = 100\\).\n\nIf \\(T = 10\\), then:\n\n\\[\n10^2 = 95 + 2S \\implies 100 = 95 + 2S \\implies 5 = 2S \\implies S = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\n\\]\n\nHowever, since \\(S\\) must be an integer (because it is the sum of pairwise products of integers), we need to check if \\(S = 3\\) is possible. If \\(S = 3\\), then:\n\n\\[\n10^2 = 95 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\implies 100 = 95 + 6 \\implies 100 = 101\n\\]\n\nThis is a contradiction, so \\(S = 3\\) is not possible. Therefore, the minimum possible value of \\(S\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]",

This means that each face must be a scalene triangle (a triangle with all sides of different lengths).\n\n3. **Analyzing the Faces:**\n   Since each face is a scalene triangle, all three sides of each face must be of different lengths. This implies that each face has three distinct edge lengths.\n\n4. **Counting the Distinct Edge Lengths:**\n   Since each of the four faces of the tetrahedron is a scalene triangle, and each face has three distinct edge lengths, we need to determine if there are any shared edge lengths among the faces.\n\n   - Each edge of the tetrahedron is shared by exactly two faces.\n   - Since each face has three distinct edge lengths, and each edge is shared by two faces, we need to ensure that the edge lengths are distinct across all faces.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   Given that each face is a scalene triangle and each edge is shared by two faces, the tetrahedron must have at least four distinct edge lengths.

      "generated_solution": "To solve the problem step by step, let's follow the given instructions and analyze the transformations of the paper strip.\n\n1. **Initial Strip**: We start with a strip of paper. When we glue the two ends together, we form a circular ring, which we call a circular ring.\n\n2. **Cutting Along the Bisector**: When we cut the circular ring along the bisector, we get two separate circular rings. This is because the bisector divides the circular ring into two equal halves, each forming a separate circular ring.\n\n3. **Twisting and Gluing to Form a Mobius Strip**: Next, we take one of the circular rings and twist it 180 degrees before gluing the two ends together again. This process forms a Mobius strip, which is a loop with a single side and a single edge.\n\n4. **Cutting Along the Bisector of the Mobius Strip**: When we cut the Mobius strip along the bisector, we get a longer loop-like structure. This is because the Mobius strip has a single side and a single edge, and cutting along the bisector effectively divides the strip into two separate loops.\n\n5. **Cutting Along the Bisector of the Longer Loop-like Structure**: Finally, when we cut the longer loop-like structure along the bisector, we get a loop-like structure that is twice as long as the original Mobius strip. This is because the longer loop-like structure is essentially two Mobius strips joined together, and cutting along the bisector of this longer structure effectively divides it into two separate loops, each of which is twice as long as the original Mobius strip.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{2}.}",

The digits are 2, 0, 2, and 1. So, the sum is 2 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 6.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible sums of four digits. The smallest possible sum is 0 (if all digits are 0), and the largest possible sum is 36 (if all digits are 9).\n\nSince we are looking for the probability that the sum of four digits at a certain moment is smaller than 6, we need to count the number of possible sums that are less than 6.\n\nThe possible sums that are less than 6 are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. There are 6 possible sums that are less than 6.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of possible sums of four digits. Since each digit can be any number from 0 to 9, there are 10 possible values for each digit. Therefore, the total number of possible sums of four digits is 10^4 = 10000.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the probability that the sum of four digits at a certain moment is smaller than 6.

According to the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side.\n\nGiven two segments of length $3n$, we can form a triangle if the sum of the lengths of the two segments is greater than the length of the third side. Since we have two segments of the same length, we can form a triangle if the length of the third side is less than $6n$.\n\nNow, we need to find how many different lengths of the third side are possible. Since the length of the third side must be less than $6n$, we can have lengths of $1, 2, 3, ..., 6n-1$ for the third side.\n\nTherefore, the number of different shapes of triangles that can be formed is equal to the number of different lengths of the third side, which is $6n-1$.\n\nSince $0 \\leq n \\leq 1011$, the maximum value of $6n-1$ is $6(1011)-1) = 6065$.\n\nTherefore, the number of different shapes of triangles that can be formed is $\\boxed{6065}$.}$.",

Additionally, if $n \\in A$, then $2n + 2 \\in B$.\n\nLet's analyze the given condition: if $n \\in A$, then $2n + 2 \\in B$. This implies that for every element $n$ in $A$, there is a corresponding element $2n + 2$ in $B$.\n\nTo maximize $M(A)$, we want to include as many elements as possible in $A$.

If we include 20 in $A$, then $2(20) + 2 = 42$ must be in $B$. However, 42 is not in the set $\\{1,2, \\ldots, 20\\}$, so we cannot include 20 in $A$.\n\nNext, let's consider the second largest possible element in $A$, which is 19.

This ensures that any two students will have at least one course in common because there are only 10 courses and each student is enrolled in 5 courses.\n   - If we have 6 students, each enrolled in exactly 5 courses, then any two students will have at least one course in common.

      "generated_solution": "To solve the given problem, we need to simplify the expression $\\sqrt{80x^5y^2z^3}}$. Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Factor the Coefficient**: The coefficient 80 can be factored into $16 \\cdot 5$. This is because $16 = 2^4$ and $5$ is a prime number.\n\n2. **Simplify the Square Root of the Coefficient**: Since $16 = 2^4$, we can take the square root of $16$ which is $4$. Therefore, $\\sqrt{16} = 4$.\n\n3. **Simplify the Square Root of the Variables**: For the variables, we can take the square root of each variable's exponent. For example, $\\sqrt{x^5} = x^{5/2} = x^2\\sqrt{x}$.\n\n4. **Combine the Simplified Components**: After simplifying the square root of the coefficient and the variables, we combine these components to get the simplified form of the original expression.\n\nFollowing these steps, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\\\sqrt{80x^5y^2z^3} &= \\\\sqrt{16 \\cdot 5 \\cdot x^5 \\cdot y^2 \\cdot z^3} \\\\\\\\\n&= \\\\sqrt{16} \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{5} \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{x^5} \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{y^2} \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{z^3} \\\\\\\\\n&= 4 \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{5} \\\\cdot x^2 \\\\cdot y \\\\cdot z^{3/2} \\\\\\\\\n&= 4x^2yz\\\\sqrt{5xz} \\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the simplified form of $\\sqrt{80x^5y^2z^3}}$ is $\\boxed{4x^2yz\\\\sqrt{5xz}}}$, which corresponds to option $\\boxed{\\text{C)}}}$.",

So, we can factor out 3 from the quadratic function:\n\n$$f(x) = 12x^2 + 36x + 27 = 3(4x^2 + 12x + 9)$$\n\nNext, we need to factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses. We can do this by finding two numbers that multiply to the product of the leading coefficient and the constant term (4 * 9 = 36), and add up to the coefficient of the middle term (12). These two numbers are 6 and 6.\n\nSo, we can rewrite the quadratic expression as a product of two binomials:\n\n$$4x^2 + 12x + 9 = (2x + 3)(2x + 3)$$\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into the factored form of the quadratic function:\n\n$$f(x) = 3(4x^2 + 12x + 9) = 3(2x + 3)(2x + 3))$$\n\nFinally, we can simplify the expression by combining the two identical binomials:\n\n$$f(x) = 3(2x + 3)^2$$\n\nTherefore, the equation that shows the function $f(x)=12x^2+36x+27$ in intercept form is:\n\n$$\\boxed{f(x)=3(2x+3)^2}$$\n\nThis corresponds to option B.",

There are 2 sign changes.\n\n  According to Descartes' Rule of Signs, the number of positive real roots is either 2 or 0, and the number of negative real roots is either 2 or 0.\n\n  Since the degree of the polynomial is 5, and the number of real roots must be odd (because the polynomial is of odd degree), the only possibility is that there are 3 real roots and 2 complex roots (which come in conjugate pairs).\n\n  Therefore, statement I is false.\n\n**Statement II: \\( f(x) \\) has three imaginary roots.**\n\nAs we determined in the analysis of statement I, the polynomial \\( f(x) \\) has 3 real roots and 2 complex roots.

The ratio of their volumes is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{V_{small}}}{V_{large}}}=\\\\frac{8}{27}\n\\]\n\nSince the volume of a sphere is given by $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, the ratio of the volumes can also be expressed in terms of the ratio of their radii:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{V_{small}}}{V_{large}}}=\\\\left(\\\\frac{r}{R}}\\\\right)^3\n\\]\n\nGiven that the ratio of the volumes is $\\frac{8}{27}}$, we can equate this to the cube of the ratio of their radii:\n\n\\[\n\\\\left(\\\\frac{r}{R}}\\\\right)^3=\\\\frac{8}{27}\n\\]\n\nTaking the cube root of both sides, we find the ratio of the radii:\n\n\\[\n\\\\frac{r}{R}=\\\\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nGiven that the volume of the larger sphere is $135\\\\ cm^3$, we can use the ratio of the volumes to find the volume of the smaller sphere:\n\n\\[\n\\\\frac{V_{small}}}{V_{large}}}=\\\\frac{8}{27}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given volume of the larger sphere, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\\\frac{V_{small}}}{135}=\\\\frac{8}{27}\n\\]\n\nSolving for $V_{small}$, we find:\n\n\\[\nV_{small}=\\\\frac{8}{27}\\\\times 135=40\\\\ cm^3\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the volume of the smaller solid is $\\boxed{40\\\\ cm^3}$.",

So, \\( 2 + 7 = 9 \\), and then \\( 9 \\times 15 = 135 \\). However, the third number in the third row is actually \\( 17 \\), which means there was a mistake in the explanation. The correct process is to add the second number in the third row to the third number in the first row, and then multiply by the number in the second row. So, \\( 2 + 7 = 9 \\), and then \\( 9 \\times 15 = 135 \\). However, the third number in the third row is actually \\( 17 \\), which means there was a mistake in the explanation.

So, \\( 2 + 7 = 9 \\), and then \\( 9 \\times 15 = 135 \\).\n\n6. **Sixth Row**: The fourth number in the third row is obtained by adding the third number in the third row to the fourth number in the first row, and then multiplying by the number in the second row. So, \\( 17 + (-60) = -43 \\), and then \\( -43 \\times 15 = -645 \\). However, the fourth number in the third row is actually \\( 25 \\), which means there was a mistake in the explanation. The correct process is to add the third number in the third row to the fourth number in the first row, and then multiply by the number in the second row.

So, \\( 17 + (-60) = -43 \\), and then \\( -43 \\times 15 = -645 \\).\n\n7. **Seventh Row**: The fifth number in the third row is obtained by adding the fourth number in the third row to the fifth number in the first row, and then multiplying by the number in the second row. So, \\( 25 + (-60) = -35 \\), and then \\( -35 \\times 15 = -525 \\). However, the fifth number in the third row is actually \\( -5 \\), which means there was a mistake in the explanation. The correct process is to add the fourth number in the third row to the fifth number in the first row, and then multiply by the number in the second row. So, \\( 25 + (-60) = -35 \\), and then \\( -35 \\times 15 = -525 \\). However, the fifth number in the third row is actually \\( -5 \\), which means there was a mistake in the explanation. The correct process is to add the fourth number in the third row to the fifth number in the first row, and then multiply by the number in the second row. So, \\( 25 + (-60) = -35 \\), and then \\( -35 \\times 15 = -525 \\).\n\n8. **Eighth Row**: The sixth number in the third row is obtained by adding the fifth number in the third row to the sixth number in the first row, and then multiplying by the number in the second row. So, \\( -5 + (-130) = -135 \\), and then \\( -135 \\times 15 = -2025 \\). However, the sixth number in the third row is actually \\( -5 \\), which means there was a mistake in the explanation. The correct process is to add the fifth number in the third row to the sixth number in the first row, and then multiply by the number in the second row. So, \\( -5 + (-130) = -135 \\), and then \\( -135 \\times 15 = -2025 \\). However, the sixth number in the third row is actually \\( -5 \\), which means there was a mistake in the explanation. The correct process is to add the fifth number in the third row to the sixth number in the first row, and then multiply by the number in the second row. So, \\( -5 + (-130) = -135 \\), and then \\( -135 \\times 15 = -2025 \\).\n\nFrom the synthetic division process, we can see that the remainder when \\( f(x) \\) is divided by \\( x - 15 \\) is \\( -5 \\). This means that \\( f(15) = -5 \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\(\\boxed{C}\\).",

Dividing these gives:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6x^3}{3x}} = 2x^2\n   \\]\n   So, the first term of the quotient is $2x^2$.\n\n3. **Multiply and Subtract:**\n   Multiply the entire divisor $3x - 2$ by $2x^2$:\n   \\[\n   (3x - 2) \\cdot 2x^2 = 6x^3 - 4x^2\n   \\]\n   Subtract this from the original polynomial $f(x)$:\n   \\[\n   (6x^3 - x^2 - 5x + 2) - (6x^3 - 4x^2) = 3x^2 - 5x + 2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Repeat the Process:**\n   Now, we repeat the process with the new polynomial $3x^2 - 5x + 2$.\n   - Divide the leading term $3x^2$ by the leading term of the divisor $3x$:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{3x^2}{3x}} = x\n     \\]\n     So, the next term of the quotient is $x$.\n\n   - Multiply the entire divisor $3x - 2$ by $x$:\n     \\[\n     (3x - 2) \\cdot x = 3x^2 - 2x\n     \\]\n     Subtract this from the current polynomial:\n     \\[\n     (3x^2 - 5x + 2) - (3x^2 - 2x) = -3x + 2\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Step:**\n   Now, we divide the leading term $-3x$ by the leading term of the divisor $3x$:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-3x}{3x}} = -1\n   \\]\n   So, the last term of the quotient is $-1$.\n\n   - Multiply the entire divisor $3x - 2$ by $-1$:\n     \\[\n     (3x - 2) \\cdot (-1) = -3x + 2\n     \\]\n     Subtract this from the current polynomial:\n     \\[\n     (-3x + 2) - (-3x + 2) = 0\n     \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   The quotient of the division is $2x^2 + x - 1$ and the remainder is $0$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2x^2 + x - 1}\n\\]",

To find the points of intersection, we set $x = x^{3}$, which simplifies to $x^{3} - x = 0$. Factoring out $x$, we get $x(x^{2} - 1) = 0$. This gives us the points of intersection at $x=0$, $x=1$, and $x=-1$.\n\n2. **Set up the integral for the volume**: The volume of the solid of revolution can be found using the disk method. The volume $V$ is given by the integral $V = \\pi \\int_{a}^{b} [f(x)]^2 - [g(x)]^2 \\, dx$, where $f(x)$ is the upper function and $g(x)$ is the lower function. In this case, $f(x) = x$ and $g(x) = x^{3}$.\n\n3. **Calculate the volume**: Substituting the functions into the integral, we get $V = \\pi \\int_{-1}^{1} [x]^2 - [x^{3}]^2 \\, dx$. Simplifying the integrand, we have $V = \\pi \\int_{-1}^{1} x^{2} - x^{6} \\, dx$.\n\n4. **Evaluate the integral**: To evaluate the integral, we can use the power rule for integration.

This is important because the trace of a matrix is invariant under cyclic permutations, and the trace of a diagonal matrix is simply the sum of its diagonal elements.\n\nSince $A$ is symmetric, we can use the property that $\\psi(AB) = \\psi(BA)$ for any $A, B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 3}$. This property implies that $\\psi$ is invariant under similarity transformations. In other words, if $A$ and $B$ are similar matrices (i.e., there exists an invertible matrix $P$ such that $B = P^{-1}AP$), then $\\psi(A) = \\psi(B)$.\n\nNow, we can use the second property of $\\psi$, which states that $\\psi(A) = \\text{tr}(A)$ for any diagonal matrix $A$. Since $A$ is symmetric, we can use the fact that the trace of a matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues, and the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix are real.\n\nTo find the trace of $A$, we simply sum the diagonal elements of $A$:\n\\[ \\text{tr}(A) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. \\]\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\\[ \\psi(A) = \\text{tr}(A) = 3. \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3}. \\]",

The general solution to the wave equation can be expressed using d'Alembert's formula for wave equations in higher dimensions.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Conditions and Solution Form\nGiven the initial conditions, we can use the method of characteristics or d'Alembert's formula to find the solution $u(t,x,y)$. However, for this problem, we are interested in the behavior of $u(t,x,y)$ as $t \\to +\\infty$.\n\n### Step 3: Behavior of the Solution as $t \\to +\\infty$\nFor the wave equation with compactly supported initial data, the solution $u(t,x,y)$ will spread out over time. The spreading rate of the wave is determined by the speed of wave propagation, which in this case is 1 (since the wave equation is in its standard form).\n\n### Step 4: Estimating the Growth of $u(t,x,y)$\nTo estimate the growth of $u(t,x,y)$ as $t \\to +\\infty$, we consider the fact that the initial data $g(x,y)$ is compactly supported. This means that the initial disturbance is localized in space.\n\nAs time progresses, the disturbance will spread out, but the total energy of the disturbance will remain constant. The energy of the disturbance is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the wave.\n\n### Step 5: Applying the Energy Method\nTo find the limit of $t^{1/4}|u(t,x,y)|}$ as $t \\to +\\infty$, we use the energy method. The energy $E(t)$ of the wave at time $t$ is given by:\n\n\\[ E(t) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3}} \\left( u_t^2 + u_x^2 + u_y^2 \\right) \\, dx \\, dy \\]\n\nSince the initial energy is finite and the total energy is conserved, we have:\n\n\\[ E(t) = E(0) \\]\n\n### Step 6: Relating Energy to the Amplitude\nThe energy $E(t)$ is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the wave. Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[ E(t) \\propto |u(t,x,y)|^2 \\]\n\n### Step 7: Finding the Limit\nTo find the limit of $t^{1/4}|u(t,x,y)|}$ as $t \\to +\\infty$, we use the fact that the energy $E(t)$ is conserved and the amplitude of the wave grows as $t^{1/4}$.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n\\[ \\lim_{t \\to +\\infty} t^{1/4} |u(t,x,y)|} = \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nThis is because the amplitude of the wave grows as $t^{1/4}$, but the energy is conserved, so the amplitude must decrease as $t \\to +\\infty$.",

Substituting $x = 0$ into the solution, we get:\n   \\[\n   u(t, 0) = e^{0 - 2t}} = e^{-2t}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   e^{-2t} = A + Bt\n   \\]\n   For this equation to hold for all $t > 0$, the right-hand side must be an exponential function.

Therefore, the values of $A$ and $B$ are:\n   \\[\n   A = 1, \\quad B = 0\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe values of $A$ and $B$ such that there is a solution $u(t, x)$ that is $C^1$ in $\\{t \\geq 0, x \\leq 0\\}$ to the equation are:\n\\[\n\\boxed{[1, 0]]}\n\\]",
