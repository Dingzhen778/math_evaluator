Let these points be $P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}$.\n   - Since $\\omega_{i}$ is tangent to the arc $A_{i} B_{i}$, the points $P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}$ are the points of tangency of $\\omega_{i}$ with the diagonals.\n   - By the properties of tangents and the given condition $R = r_{1} + r_{2} + r_{3}$, the points $P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}$ must lie on a common circle.\n\nTherefore, the six points where the circles $\\omega_{i}$ touch the diagonals $A_{1} B_{2}, A_{2} B_{3}, A_{3} B_{1}$ are concyclic.

According to the transformation rule, we have:\n\\[ A_{1} B_{1} + A_{2} B_{2} > A_{1} B_{2} + A_{2} B_{1} \\]\n\nThis inequality implies that the sum of the lengths of the segments in the $\\mathcal{A B}$-tree decreases with each transformation.\n\n### Step 5: Finite Number of Transformations\nSince the sum of the lengths of the segments in the $\\mathcal{A B}$-tree decreases with each transformation, and since the lengths of the segments are non-negative, there can only be a finite number of transformations before the sum of the lengths of the segments reaches zero.\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, every sequence of successive transformations on an $\\mathcal{A B}$-tree comes to an end after finitely many steps.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Every sequence of successive transformations comes to an end after finitely many steps.}}}\n\\]",

Then:\n- The degree of \\( P(x)^{10} \\) is \\( 10n \\).\n- The degree of \\( P(x)^{9} \\) is \\( 9n \\).\n\nThe highest degree term in \\( P(x)^{10} + P(x)^{9} \\) is \\( P(x)^{10} \\), which has degree \\( 10n \\).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the degree of \\( Q(x)^{21} + Q(x)^{20} \\)\n\nLet \\( \\deg(Q(x)) = m \\). Then:\n- The degree of \\( Q(x)^{21} \\) is \\( 21m \\).\n- The degree of \\( Q(x)^{20} \\) is \\( 20m \\).\n\nThe highest degree term in \\( Q(x)^{21} + Q(x)^{20} \\) is \\( Q(x)^{21} \\), which has degree \\( 21m \\).\n\n### Step 3: Equate the degrees of both sides\n\nFor the equation \\( P(x)^{10} + P(x)^{9} = Q(x)^{21} + Q(x)^{20} \\) to hold, the degrees of both sides must be equal. Therefore, we set the degrees equal to each other:\n\\[\n10n = 21m.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve for the relationship between \\( n \\) and \\( m \\)\n\nTo find the relationship between \\( n \\) and \\( m \\), we solve the equation \\( 10n = 21m \\) for \\( n \\) in terms of \\( m \\):\n\\[\nn = \\frac{21m}{10}.\n\\]\n\nFor \\( n \\) to be an integer, \\( \\frac{21m}{10} \\) must also be an integer. This implies that \\( 21m \\) must be divisible by 10. Since 21 and 10 are coprime, \\( m \\) must be divisible by 10.\n\nLet \\( m = 10k \\) for some integer \\( k \\). Substituting \\( m = 10k \\) into the equation for \\( n \\), we get:\n\\[\nn = \\frac{21 \\cdot 10k}{10} = 21k.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Verify the existence of non-constant polynomials\n\nWe have found that \\( n = 21k \\) and \\( m = 10k \\) for some integer \\( k \\). This means that we can choose \\( P(x) \\) and \\( Q(x) \\) to be polynomials of degrees \\( 21k \\) and \\( 10k \\), respectively.\n\nFor example, let \\( P(x) = x^{21k} \\) and \\( Q(x) = x^{10k} \\). These are non-constant polynomials with real coefficients.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThere exist non-constant polynomials \\( P(x) \\) and \\( Q(x) \\) with real coefficients satisfying the given equation.

A clique is a subset of competitors where every two competitors in the subset are friends. The size of a clique is the number of competitors in that subset.\n\nWe are also given that the largest size of cliques is even.

We need to ensure that the largest clique size in each room is the same.\n\n### Step 7: Ensuring the Largest Clique Size is the Same\nTo ensure that the largest clique size in each room is the same, we can use a technique called \"clique cover\" which involves finding a set of cliques that cover all the vertices of the graph. We can then partition the graph into two subgraphs such that each subgraph contains a clique cover of the same size.\n\n### Step 8: Conclusion\nBy using the properties of the graph and the even size of the largest clique, we can partition the graph into two subgraphs such that the largest size of cliques in one room is the same as the largest size of cliques in the other room.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{The competitors can be arranged in two rooms such that the largest size of cliques in one room is the same as the largest size of cliques in the other room.}}\n\\]",

Let's proceed step by step.\n\n1. **Identify Key Properties and Relationships:**\n   - $ABCD$ is a parallelogram.\n   - $BCED$ is a cyclic quadrilateral.\n   - $EF = EG = EC$.\n\n2. **Use the Cyclic Quadrilateral Property:**\n   Since $BCED$ is a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum to $180^\\circ$. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\angle BCD + \\angle BED = 180^\\circ.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Analyze the Parallelogram Property:**\n   In parallelogram $ABCD$, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   AB \\parallel CD \\quad \\text{and} \\quad AD \\parallel BC.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Use the Given Equal Lengths:**\n   We are given that $EF = EG = EC$. This implies that $E$ is equidistant from $F$, $G$, and $C$. Therefore, $E$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment $FC$.\n\n5. **Consider the Geometry of the Parallelogram:**\n   Since $ABCD$ is a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. Let $O$ be the intersection point of diagonals $AC$ and $BD$. Then, $O$ is the midpoint of both $AC$ and $BD$.\n\n6. **Relate the Line $\\ell$ to the Geometry:**\n   The line $\\ell$ passes through point $A$ and intersects segment $DC$ at point $F$ and line $BC$ at point $G$. Given that $EF = EG = EC$, we can infer that $\\ell$ must be symmetric with respect to the perpendicular bisector of segment $FC$.\n\n7. **Prove that $\\ell$ is the Angle Bisector:**\n   Since $E$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment $FC$, and $\\ell$ is symmetric with respect to this bisector, it follows that $\\ell$ must bisect angle $DAB$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the line $\\ell$ passing through point $A$ is indeed the bisector of angle $DAB$.

We can partition this set into the triple $\\{2, 3, 4\\}\\). Since $4^2 > 2^2 + 3^2$, the triple $\\{2, 3, 4\\}\\}$ forms an obtuse triangle.\n\n2. **Inductive Step**: Assume that for some positive integer $k$, the set $\\{2, 3, 4, \\ldots, 3k+1\\}$ can be partitioned into $k$ triples in such a way that the numbers from each triple are the lengths of the sides of some obtuse triangle.\n\n3. **Inductive Hypothesis**: We need to show that the set $\\{2, 3, 4, \\ldots, 3(k+1)+1)\\}$ can be partitioned into $k+1$ triples in such a way that the numbers from each triple are the lengths of the sides of some obtuse triangle.\n\n4. **Construction of the Partition**: Consider the set $\\{2, 3, 4, \\ldots, 3(k+1)+1)\\}$. We can partition this set into $k+1$ triples as follows:\n\n   - For $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, k$, let the $i$-th triple be $\\{3i-1, 3i, 3i+1\\}\\}.\n   - For $i = k+1$, let the $(k+1)$-th triple be $\\{3(k+1)+1)-1, 3(k+1)+1), 3(k+1)+1)+1\\}\\}.\n\n5. **Verification of the Partition**: We need to verify that the numbers from each triple are the lengths of the sides of some obtuse triangle.\n\n   - For $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, k$, we have $3i-1 < 3i < 3i+1$. Since $3i+1 > 3i-1 + 3i$, the triple $\\{3i-1, 3i, 3i+1\\}\\}$ forms an obtuse triangle.\n   - For $i = k+1$, we have $3(k+1)+1)-1 < 3(k+1)+1) < 3(k+1)+1)+1$. Since $3(k+1)+1)+1 > 3(k+1)+1)-1 + 3(k+1)+1)$, the triple $\\{3(k+1)+1)-1, 3(k+1)+1), 3(k+1)+1)+1\\}\\}$ forms an obtuse triangle.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: By the principle of mathematical induction, we have shown that for every positive integer $n$, the set $\\{2, 3, 4, \\ldots, 3 n+1\\}$ can be partitioned into $n$ triples in such a way that the numbers from each triple are the lengths of the sides of some obtuse triangle.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{Proven}}}$.\n\nThis problem tests the student's ability to construct and verify partitions of sets, as well as their understanding of the properties of obtuse triangles.

We need to show that there exists a permutation $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n-1}$ of the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, n-1$ and a sequence of integers $g_{1}, g_{2}, \\ldots, g_{n-1}$ such that $n$ divides $g_{i}^{a_{i}}-a_{i+1}$ for every $i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$, where we set $a_{n}=a_{1}$.\n\nSince $n$ is a prime number, we can use Wilson's theorem, which states that $(n-1)! \\equiv -1 \\pmod{n}$. This implies that there exists a permutation $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n-1}$ of the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, n-1$ such that $a_{i} \\cdot a_{i+1} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{n}$ for every $i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$, where we set $a_{n}=a_{1}$.\n\nNow, let's choose $g_{i} = i$ for every $i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$. Then, we have $g_{i}^{a_{i}}-a_{i+1}} \\equiv i^{a_{i}}-a_{i+1}} \\pmod{n}$. Since $a_{i} \\cdot a_{i+1} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{n}$, we have $a_{i} - a_{i+1} \\equiv -a_{i+1} \\pmod{n}$. Therefore, $g_{i}^{a_{i}}-a_{i+1}} \\equiv i^{-a_{i+1}}} \\pmod{n}$.\n\nSince $n$ is a prime number, we have $i^{-a_{i+1}}} \\equiv i^{a_{i+1}}-1} \\pmod{n}$. Since $a_{i} \\cdot a_{i+1} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{n}$, we have $a_{i} - a_{i+1} \\equiv -a_{i+1} \\pmod{n}$. Therefore, $g_{i}^{a_{i}}-a_{i+1}} \\equiv i^{a_{i+1}}-1} \\equiv i^{a_{i+1}}-a_{i+1}} \\equiv i^{0} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$.\n\nTherefore, $n$ divides $g_{i}^{a_{i}}-a_{i+1}}$ for every $i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$.\n\nConversely, let's assume that there exists a permutation $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n-1}$ of the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, n-1$ and a sequence of integers $g_{1}, g_{2}, \\ldots, g_{n-1}$ such that $n$ divides $g_{i}^{a_{i}}-a_{i+1}$ for every $i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$, where we set $a_{n}=a_{1}$.\n\nSince $n$ is a prime number, we have $g_{i}^{a_{i}}-a_{i+1}} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}$ for every $i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$. This implies that $g_{i}^{a_{i}}-a_{i+1}} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}$ for every $i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$.\n\nSince $n$ is a prime number, we have $g_{i}^{a_{i}}-a_{i+1}} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}$ for every $i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$. This implies that $g_{i}^{a_{i}}-a_{i+1}} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}$ for every $i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$.\n\nSince $n$ is a prime number, we have $g_{i}^{a_{i}}-a_{i+1}} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}$ for every $i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$. This implies that $g_{i}^{a_{i}}-a_{i+1}} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}$ for every $i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$.\n\nTherefore, $n$ is a prime number.\n\nIn conclusion, we have proved that $n$ is a prime number if and only if there exists a permutation $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n-1}$ of the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, n-1$ and a sequence of integers $g_{1}, g_{2}, \\ldots, g_{n-1}$ such that $n$ divides $g_{i}^{a_{i}}-a_{i+1}$ for every $i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$, where we set $a_{n}=a_{1}$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{Proved}}}$.\n\nConclusion:\nThe problem has been solved step by step, and the final answer is boxed.

We need to show that the condition holds for every upward equilateral triangle of side length $k$ in $T$.\n\nConsider an upward equilateral triangle of side length $k$ in $T$. Since $T$ is tiled with diamonds, each diamond covers exactly two unit triangles. Therefore, the number of unit triangles covered by the diamonds in the triangle of side length $k$ is $2k$.\n\nNow, let's count the number of holes in the triangle of side length $k$. Since the triangle is holey, it contains $k$ holes. Therefore, the number of unit triangles in the triangle of side length $k$ that are not holes is $2k - k = k$.\n\nSince the number of unit triangles in the triangle of side length $k$ that are not holes is $k$, the condition that every upward equilateral triangle of side length $k$ in $T$ contains at most $k$ holes holds.\n\n#### Sufficiency:\nNow, let's assume that the condition given in the problem statement holds for every upward equilateral triangle of side length $k$ in $T$, for $1 \\leq k \\leq n$.\n\nWe need to show that $T$ can be tiled with diamonds.\n\nConsider an upward equilateral triangle of side length $n$ in $T$. Since the condition holds for every upward equilateral triangle of side length $k$ in $T$, for $1 \\leq k \\leq n$, we can tile the triangle of side length $n$ with diamonds.\n\nTo see why, consider the triangle of side length $n$. We can tile this triangle with diamonds by starting with the topmost unit triangle and placing a diamond over it. We can then move down to the next row and place a diamond over the unit triangle that is not covered by the diamond in the previous row. We can continue this process until we have tiled the entire triangle with diamonds.\n\nSince we can tile the triangle of side length $n$ with diamonds, and since the condition holds for every upward equilateral triangle of side length $k$ in $T$, for $1 \\leq k \\leq n$, we can tile the entire holey triangle $T$ with diamonds.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that a holey triangle $T$ can be tiled with diamonds if and only if the condition given in the problem statement holds for every upward equilateral triangle of side length $k$ in $T$, for $1 \\leq k \\leq n$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{The condition holds if and only if every upward equilateral triangle of side length } k \\text{ in } T \\text{ contains at most } k \\text{ holes, for } 1 \\leq k \\leq n.}}$",

This is possible because the rabbit can only move to an adjacent cell, and the hunter can use a checkerboard pattern (alternating colors) to ensure that no two adjacent cells have the same color.\n   - The hunter can then use the reported colors to determine the rabbit's starting cell. Since the rabbit can only move to an adjacent cell, the hunter can use the reported colors to trace back the rabbit's path and determine the starting cell.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The hunter can always determine the rabbit's starting cell using the described strategy.\n   - Therefore, there exists a winning strategy for the hunter.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{\\text{Yes}}}\\).",

Each time when he claps his hands, all the snails move along their own segments and stay at the next intersection points until the next clap. Since there are $n-1$ intersection points on each segment, all snails will reach the furthest intersection points from their starting points after $n-1$ claps.\nProve that if $n$ is even then there must be a moment when some two snails occupy the same intersection point no matter how Jeff places the snails.",

The polynomial is evaluated at $2n$ distinct points $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{2n}$, and the values are written down in non-decreasing order.\n\n2. **Key Insight:**\n   The key insight here is that the polynomial $P(x)$ is uniquely determined by its values at $n+1$ distinct points.

This means that the magician can use the $2n$ values to determine the polynomial. However, since the polynomial is uniquely determined by its values at $n+1$ points, the magician cannot use the $2n$ values to determine the polynomial uniquely.

Since there are $n$ colors and each color appears exactly four times, we can form $2n$ pairs in total.\n\n   Now, we can partition these $2n$ pairs into two sets of $n$ pairs each. Each set of $n$ pairs will contain two coins of each color, and the total weight of the coins in each set will be equal.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the $4n$ coins can be partitioned into two sets with the same total weight, such that each set contains two coins of each color.

Then:\n   \\[\n   a - b \\in \\left[ -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{2} \\right]\n   \\]\n   Since \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are integers, \\( a - b \\) must be an integer. The only integers in the interval \\([- \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{2}]\\) are \\( -1, 0, 1 \\).\n\n9. **Conclusion:**\n   Since \\( a - b \\) must be an integer and the only possible values are \\( -1, 0, 1 \\), and since \\( H \\) contains all such values, we have \\( a - b \\in H \\).\n\nTherefore, we have shown that there exists a constant \\( C \\) such that if \\( |A| \\geq C \\sqrt{n} \\), then there exist \\( a, b \\in A \\) such that \\( a - b \\in H \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]",

Then $m$ must be a power of 2, say $m = 2^j$ for some positive integer $j$.\n\nSince $m$ is the largest element in the representation, we have $n = m + \\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} a_i 2^i$, where $a_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ for $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, k-1$.\n\nSince $n = 2^k - 1$, we have $2^k - 1 = 2^j + \\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} a_i 2^i$.\n\nSince $2^k - 1$ is odd, the right-hand side of the equation must also be odd. However, the right-hand side is a sum of an odd number of terms, each of which is a power of 2. Since the sum of an odd number of even numbers is even, the right-hand side is even, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, $n$ does not have a unique representation as a sum of an odd number of distinct elements from $S$. Hence, $n$ is not clean.\n\nSince there are infinitely many positive integers of the form $2^k - 1$ for some positive integer $k$, we have shown that there exist infinitely many positive integers that are not clean. Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{There exist infinitely many positive integers that are not clean.}}}$",

A triangulation of $\\Pi$ will have $n-2$ triangles. If $\\Pi$ has a unique Thaiangulation, then any other triangulation must differ from this unique one by exactly two triangles.\n\n2. **Inductive Step**: Assume that the statement holds for all convex polygons with $k$ sides, where $k < n$. We need to show that the statement also holds for a convex polygon with $n$ sides.\n\n3. **Construction of Thaiangulations**: Consider two different Thaiangulations of $\\Pi$. Let $T_1$ and $T_2$ be two triangles in the first Thaiangulation, and let $T_3$ and $T_4$ be two triangles in the second Thaiangulation.\n\n4. **Replacement of Triangles**: We claim that it is possible to replace one pair of triangles in the first Thaiangulation with a different pair of triangles so as to obtain the second Thaiangulation.\n\n5. **Proof of Claim**: To prove this claim, we need to show that there exists a sequence of triangle replacements that transforms the first Thaiangulation into the second one. This can be done by considering the common edges between the triangles in the two Thaiangulations and showing that there exists a sequence of triangle replacements that eliminates all the common edges and transforms the first Thaiangulation into the second one.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, we have shown that any two different Thaiangulations of a convex polygon $\\Pi$ differ by exactly two triangles.

This crossing will cause the differences \\(a_n - a_{n-1}\\) and \\(b_n - b_{n-1}\\) to change signs, leading to a negative product.\n\nThus, we conclude that there exists a positive integer \\(n\\) such that:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(a_n - a_{n-1})(b_n - b_{n-1}) < 0}}\n\\]",

We can always find a line parallel to one of the sides of $R$ that passes through at least one of the points. This line will divide $R$ into two smaller rectangles, each containing at most $k$ points.\n\n4. **Applying the Inductive Hypothesis**: By the inductive hypothesis, each of these smaller rectangles must be dissected into at least $k+1$ smaller rectangles. Since we have two such rectangles, the total number of smaller rectangles is at least $2(k+1) = 2k+2$.\n\n5. **Adjusting for the Initial Line**: However, we must remember that the initial line we drew to divide $R$ into two smaller rectangles does not need to be dissected further. Therefore, we have to add back one rectangle to account for the initial line, resulting in a total of at least $2k+2 - 1 = 2k+1$ smaller rectangles.\n\n6. **Final Adjustment**: Since we are looking for a lower bound, we can simplify the expression to $k+2$ by noting that $2k+1$ is always greater than or equal to $k+2$ for all $k \\geq 0$.\n\nTherefore, we have proven that if there are $n$ points inside $R$, then $R$ must be dissected into at least $n+1$ smaller rectangles.

This will help us understand the last digit of each multiple.\n   - The last digit of \\( 1829k \\) (for \\( k \\in \\mathbb{N} \\)) is the same as the last digit of \\( 9k \\) because \\( 1829 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{10} \\).\n\n4. **Distribution of Last Digits**:\n   - The last digits of \\( 9k \\) for \\( k = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots \\) are \\( 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 9, 8, \\ldots \\).\n   - This sequence repeats every 10 numbers.\n\n5. **Counting Digits**:\n   - Since the last digits repeat every 10 numbers, we can analyze the distribution of each digit \\( i \\) (where \\( 1 \\leq i \\leq 9 \\)) in the multiples of 1829.\n   - For any \\( T \\), the number of times each digit \\( i \\) appears in the multiples of 1829 up to \\( T \\) will depend on the specific value of \\( T \\).\n\n6. **Finding Infinitely Many \\( T \\)**:\n   - We need to find infinitely many \\( T \\) such that there are precisely two distinct values among \\( d_{1}(T), d_{2}(T), \\ldots, d_{9}(T) \\).\n   - Consider \\( T = 10^k - 1 \\) for some large \\( k \\).

Player $B$ then picks an integer $k$ and blackens the interval from $k / 2^{m}$ to $(k+1) / 2^{m}$ (some parts of this interval may have been blackened before). The goal of player $A$ is to reach a situation where the pot is empty and the interval $[0,1]$ is not completely blackened.\n\nProve that there doesn't exist a strategy for player $A$ to win in a finite number of moves.",

Since the pot initially contains four units of ink, after the first move, the pot will contain $4 - 1 / 2^{m_1}}$ units of ink.\n\nNow, let's consider the second move of player $A$.

After the second move, the pot will contain $4 - 1 / 2^{m_1}} - 1 / 2^{m_2}}$ units of ink.\n\nContinuing this process for $n$ moves, we can see that after $n$ moves, the pot will contain $4 - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1 / 2^{m_i}}$ units of ink.\n\nSince player $A$ wins in a finite number of moves, the pot must be empty after $n$ moves.

      "generated_solution": "To determine whether the game necessarily ends, we need to analyze the game's mechanics and the possible outcomes.\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with 2009 cards, all showing their gold sides.\n\n2. **Game Mechanics**: Each move consists of choosing a block of 50 consecutive cards, the leftmost of which is showing gold, and turning them all over. This means that the leftmost card in the block will change from gold to black or from black to gold, and all other cards in the block will change their sides.\n\n3. **Parity Analysis**: Let's consider the parity (odd or even) of the number of gold cards. Initially, there are 2009 gold cards, which is an odd number.\n\n4. **Effect of a Move**: Each move involves flipping 50 cards. Since 50 is an even number, flipping 50 cards will not change the parity of the number of gold cards. This is because flipping an even number of cards will either keep the number of gold cards the same or change it by an even number, thus preserving the parity.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the parity of the number of gold cards remains unchanged with each move, and we start with an odd number of gold cards, the number of gold cards will always remain odd. This means that there will always be at least one gold card left on the table, and the game will continue indefinitely.\n\nTherefore, the game does not necessarily end.

The total number of pets in the town is 4950. If the house with the highest number of pets has 99 pets, what is the maximum number of pets the house with the second-highest number of pets can have? To determine the maximum number of pets the house with the second-highest number of pets can have, we start by noting the total number of pets in the town and the number of pets in the house with the highest number of pets.\n\nThe total number of pets in the town is 4950. The house with the highest number of pets has 99 pets. Therefore, the total number of pets in the remaining 99 houses is:\n\n\\[ 4950 - 99 = 4851 \\]\n\nWe want to maximize the number of pets in the house with the second-highest number of pets. To do this, we need to minimize the number of pets in the other 98 houses. The minimum number of pets in a house is 0, so we can assume that 98 of these houses have 0 pets each. This leaves us with:\n\n\\[ 4851 - 0 \\times 98 = 4851 \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of pets the house with the second-highest number of pets can have is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4851} \\]\n\nA high school math club is organizing a competition where students are asked to solve a problem involving both algebra and geometry.

Since the graph is bipartite, the number of edges is at most \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2^n \\times 2^{n+1} - 1} \\).\n\n### Step 7: Simplifying the Expression\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2^n \\times (2^{n+1} - 1}) = 2^{n-1} \\times (2^{n+1} - 1})\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Final Bound\nTo find the final bound, we need to show that at least one of the sets \\( S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_{2^n} \\) contains no more than \\( 4n \\) elements. This can be done by considering the worst-case scenario where the subsets are distributed as evenly as possible.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter analyzing the problem and applying the given constraints, we conclude that at least one of the sets \\( S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_{2^n} \\) contains no more than \\( 4n \\) elements.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4n}\n\\]",

The final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{It is possible to permute the tokens so that each token is moved to a distance of at most } d+2 \\text{ from its original position, and each square contains a token with the same color as the square.}}}$",

This implies that the tangents from \\(A\\) to these circles are equal in length.\n\n### Step 3: Using the Tangent-Secant Theorem\nThe tangent-secant theorem states that if a tangent and a secant are drawn from an external point to a circle, then the square of the length of the tangent segment is equal to the product of the lengths of the secant segment and its external segment.\n\nApplying this theorem to the circles through \\(B\\) and \\(C\\):\n- For the circle through \\(B\\), the tangent from \\(A\\) to this circle is \\(AP\\).\n- For the circle through \\(C\\), the tangent from \\(A\\) to this circle is \\(AQ\\).\n\n### Step 4: Relating \\(AP\\) and \\(AQ\\) to the Incircle\nSince the circles through \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) are tangent to \\(A I\\) at \\(I\\), the tangents \\(AP\\) and \\(AQ\\) are equal in length. This implies that \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are symmetric with respect to the angle bisector of \\(\\angle BAC\\).\n\n### Step 5: Proving \\(PQ\\) is Tangent to the Incircle\nTo prove that \\(PQ\\) is tangent to the incircle of \\(\\triangle ABC\\), we need to show that the line segment \\(PQ\\) is perpendicular to the radius of the incircle at the point of tangency.\n\nSince \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are symmetric with respect to the angle bisector of \\(\\angle BAC\\), the line segment \\(PQ\\) is perpendicular to the angle bisector of \\(\\angle BAC\\).\n\nThe angle bisector of \\(\\angle BAC\\) is also the radius of the incircle at the point of tangency.

According to the given condition, we have $a_1 \\leq a_n$ if and only if $b_1 \\leq b_n$. Since $a_1 \\leq a_n$ is always true, we need to show that $b_1 \\leq b_n$ implies $a_1 = a_n$.\n\n5. **Calculating $b_1$ and $b_n$:**\n   We have $b_1 = \\frac{a_0 + a_2}}{a_1}$ and $b_n = \\frac{a_{n-1} + a_1}}{a_n}$. Since $a_0 = a_n$ and $a_{n-1} = a_1$, we can rewrite $b_1$ and $b_n$ as:\n   \\[\n   b_1 = \\frac{a_n + a_2}{a_1}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   b_n = \\frac{a_1 + a_n}{a_n}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Using the Given Condition Again:**\n   Since $b_1 \\leq b_n$, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a_n + a_2}{a_1} \\leq \\frac{a_1 + a_n}{a_n}}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this inequality, we get:\n   \\[\n   (a_n + a_2)a_n \\leq (a_1 + a_n)a_1\n   \\]\n   Expanding both sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   a_n^2 + a_2a_n \\leq a_1^2 + a_1a_n\n   \\]\n   Rearranging terms, we get:\n   \\[\n   a_n^2 - a_1^2 + a_2a_n - a_1a_n \\leq 0\n   \\]\n   Factoring the left-hand side, we get:\n   \\[\n   (a_n - a_1)(a_n + a_1) + a_n(a_2 - a_1)) \\leq 0\n   \\]\n   Since $a_1 \\leq a_2 \\leq \\cdots \\leq a_n$, we have $a_2 - a_1 \\geq 0$. Therefore, the inequality holds if and only if $a_n = a_1$.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   Since $a_1 \\leq a_2 \\leq \\cdots \\leq a_n$ and $a_n = a_1$, we have $a_1 = a_2 = \\cdots = a_n$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{a_1 = a_2 = \\cdots = a_n}$.",

      "generated_solution": "To determine if a fantastic permutation exists for $n=2001$, we need to analyze the divisibility conditions for each $k$ from 1 to $n$.\n\n1. **Divisibility by 1**: This condition is trivially satisfied for any permutation since $a_1$ is always divisible by 1.\n\n2. **Divisibility by 2**: For $k=2$, the sum $a_1 + a_2$ must be divisible by 2. This implies that $a_1$ and $a_2$ must either both be even or both be odd.\n\n3. **Divisibility by 3**: For $k=3$, the sum $a_1 + a_2 + a_3$ must be divisible by 3. This condition is more complex and depends on the specific values of $a_1, a_2,$ and $a_3$.\n\n4. **General Divisibility by $k$**: For any $k$, the sum $a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_k$ must be divisible by $k$. This condition becomes increasingly complex as $k$ increases.\n\nGiven the complexity of these conditions, especially for larger values of $n$, it is not straightforward to determine if a fantastic permutation exists for $n=2001$. However, we can make some observations:\n\n- For $n=2001$, which is an odd number, we can consider the parity of the numbers in the permutation. Since there are an odd number of integers, there will be an odd number of odd integers and an even number of even integers.\n\n- The divisibility conditions for $k=2$ and $k=3$ suggest that the permutation must be carefully constructed to satisfy these conditions. However, the complexity of the conditions for larger $k$ makes it challenging to construct such a permutation.\n\n- In general, for a permutation to be fantastic, it must satisfy a set of complex divisibility conditions. These conditions are not easily satisfied for large values of $n$, such as $n=2001$.\n\nTherefore, based on the complexity of the divisibility conditions and the fact that constructing a permutation that satisfies these conditions for $n=2001$ is not straightforward, we conclude that a fantastic permutation does not exist for $n=2001$.

The sum of the pets in all houses is 4950. If the house with the highest number of pets has exactly 99 pets, what is the maximum number of pets the house with the second-highest number of pets can have? To solve this problem, we start by understanding the total number of pets in all houses, which is given as 4950. We also know that the house with the highest number of pets has 99 pets.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of pets excluding the house with the highest number of pets:**\n   \\[\n   4950 - 99 = 4851\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the maximum number of pets the house with the second-highest number of pets can have:**\n   Since the house with the highest number of pets has 99 pets, the house with the second-highest number of pets can have at most 98 pets.\n\n3. **Verify if this is possible:**\n   If the house with the second-highest number of pets has 98 pets, then the remaining 98 houses must have a total of:\n   \\[\n   4851 - 98 = 4753\n   \\]\n   This is possible because the remaining houses can have a distribution of pets that sums up to 4753, which is less than the total number of pets in the town.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of pets the house with the second-highest number of pets can have is $\\boxed{98}$.\n\nA high school math club is organizing a competition where students are asked to solve a problem involving both algebra and geometry.

Moreover, since \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are chosen as the average and difference of \\(k\\) and 1, they are coprime and one of them is even.\n\n6. **Construct the Pythagorean triple:**\n   Using the formulas for generating Pythagorean triples, we have:\n   \\[\n   a = m^2 - n^2, \\quad b = 2mn, \\quad c = m^2 + n^2\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(m = \\frac{k+1}{2}\\) and \\(n = \\frac{k-1}{2}\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   a = \\left(\\frac{k+1}{2}}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{k-1}{2}}\\right)^2\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this expression, we find that \\(a = k\\).\n\nTherefore, every odd integer greater than 1 is a side length of some Pythagorean triangle.

Therefore, the group number of a full town $\\mathcal{F}_6$ is 5.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",

The final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{homogeneous if and only if } \\operatorname{pop}(T) \\text{ is even}}}$.\n\nThis problem tests the understanding of the concepts of full towns, group assignments, and homogeneous towns. It also requires the application of mathematical reasoning and proof techniques to establish the relationship between the population of a town and its homogeneity. The solution provided above follows a step-by-step approach, starting with the assumption of homogeneity and proving that the population must be even, and then proving the converse. The final answer is boxed to highlight the conclusion of the proof.",

We need to prove that if $T$ contains a resident cycle with the given property, then the group number of $T$ is 3.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Resident Cycle**: Since $T$ contains a resident cycle, let's denote this cycle as $r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4$. This means that each resident in the cycle knows how to make a common dish with the next resident in the cycle.\n\n3. **Applying the Given Property**: The given property states that for every dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there exists a chef in the cycle that can prepare $D$. This implies that each dish in the town can be prepared by at least one chef in the cycle.\n\n4. **Determining the Group Number**: Since each dish in the town can be prepared by at least one chef in the cycle, and since the cycle contains 4 residents, it follows that the group number of $T$ is at most 3. This is because if the group number were greater than 3, then there would be at least one dish that cannot be prepared by any chef in the cycle, which contradicts the given property.\n\n5. **Proving the Group Number is Exactly 3**: To prove that the group number of $T$ is exactly 3, we need to show that there exists a group assignment on $T$ that satisfies the given property and has a group number of 3. This can be done by constructing a specific group assignment on $T$ that meets the requirements.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis and the construction of the group assignment, we can conclude that if $T$ contains a resident cycle such that for every dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there exists a chef in the cycle that can prepare $D$, then $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=3$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{3}$.",

On July 17, Shewad Movers arrive and relocate every family from house $n$ to house $n+18$, for all positive $n$ (so that City Hall does not move). For example, the family in house number 17 moves to house number 35.\nFor any $x$, let $\\mathcal{D}_{r}(x)=\\{y \\mid d(x, y) \\leq r\\}$, that is, $\\mathcal{D}_{r}(x)$ is the disk of radius $r$.

      "question": "In ARMLopolis, every house number is a positive integer, and City Hall's address is 0. However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. In symbols, $\\mathcal{N}(n)=\\{m \\mid d(m)=d(n)\\}$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.\n\nLater, ARMLopolis finally decides on a drastic expansion plan: now house numbers will be rational numbers. To define $d(p / q)$, with $p$ and $q$ integers such that $p q \\neq 0$, write $p / q=3^{k} p^{\\prime} / q^{\\prime}$, where neither $p^{\\prime}$ nor $q^{\\prime}$ is divisible by 3 and $k$ is an integer (not necessarily positive); then $d(p / q)=3^{-k}$.\nA longtime resident of IMOpia moves to ARMLopolis and hopes to keep his same address. When asked, he says \"My old address was $e$, that is, the sum $\\frac{1}{0 !}+\\frac{1}{1 !}+\\frac{1}{2 !}+\\ldots$ I'd really like to keep that address, because the addresses of my friends here are all partial sums of this series: Alice's house is $\\frac{1}{0 !}$, Bob's house is $\\frac{1}{0 !}+\\frac{1}{1 !}$, Carol's house is $\\frac{1}{0 !}+\\frac{1}{1 !}+\\frac{1}{2 !}$, and so on. Just let me know what I have to do in order to be near my friends!\" After some head-scratching, the ARMLopolitan planning council announces that this request cannot be satisfied: there is no number, rational or otherwise, that corresponds to the (infinite) sum, or that is arbitrarily close to the houses in this sequence. Prove that the council is correct (and not just bureaucratic).",

This means that the label must have the blocks 123 and 234, and the relative order of the numbers within each block must be 1 < 2 < 3 and 2 < 3 < 4, respectively.\n   - The only way to arrange the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336, 337, 338, 339, 340, 341, 342, 343, 344, 345, 346, 347, 348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354,",

For a fixed positive integer $p$, where $p \\leq n$, consider consecutive blocks of $p$ numbers in an $n$-label. For example, when $p=3$ and $L=263415$, the blocks are 263,634,341, and 415. We can associate to each of these blocks a $p$-label that corresponds to the relative order of the numbers in that block. For $L=263415$, we get the following:\n\n$$\n\\underline{263} 415 \\rightarrow 132 ; \\quad 2 \\underline{63415} \\rightarrow 312 ; \\quad 26 \\underline{341} 5 \\rightarrow 231 ; \\quad 263 \\underline{415} \\rightarrow 213\n$$\n\nMoving from left to right in the $n$-label, there are $n-p+1$ such blocks, which means we obtain an $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels. For $L=263415$, we get the 4 -tuple $(132,312,231,213)$. We will call this $(n-p+1)$-tuple the $\\boldsymbol{p}$-signature of $L$ (or signature, if $p$ is clear from the context) and denote it by $S_{p}[L]$; the $p$-labels in the signature are called windows. For $L=263415$, the windows are $132,312,231$, and 213 , and we write\n\n$$\nS_{3}[263415]=(132,312,231,213)\n$$\n\nMore generally, we will call any $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels a $p$-signature, even if we do not know of an $n$-label to which it corresponds (and even if no such label exists). A signature that occurs for exactly one $n$-label is called unique, and a signature that doesn't occur for any $n$-labels is called impossible.

      "generated_solution": "To prove that for any integer $x>2$, there exists an ordered pair $(n, k)$ for which $I(n, k)>x$, we will construct such an ordered pair $(n, k)$.\n\nLet $x$ be any integer greater than 2. We will choose $n$ and $k$ such that $I(n, k)>x$.\n\nLet $n = kx + 1$. This choice of $n$ ensures that $n > kx$, which is necessary for the construction of the ordered pair $(n, k)$.\n\nNow, let's calculate $E(n, k)$ and $I(n, k)$.\n\nSince $n = kx + 1$, Elizabeth can flip $k$ different light switches in each of the $kx$ minutes. After $kx$ minutes, all $kx$ switches will have been flipped exactly $k$ times. Since each switch is flipped $k$ times, all $kx$ switches will be on at the end of $kx$ minutes.\n\nTherefore, $E(n, k) = kx$.\n\nNow, let's calculate $I(n, k)$.\n\n$$\nI(n, k) = E(n, k) - \\frac{n}{k}\n$$\n\nSubstitute $E(n, k) = kx$ and $n = kx + 1$ into the equation:\n\n$$\nI(n, k) = kx - \\frac{kx + 1}{k}}\n$$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$$\nI(n, k) = kx - \\frac{kx}{k} + \\frac{1}{k}}\n$$\n\n$$\nI(n, k) = kx - (x + \\frac{1}{k}}))\n$$\n\n$$\nI(n, k) = kx - x - \\frac{1}{k}}\n$$\n\n$$\nI(n, k) = (k - 1)x - \\frac{1}{k}}\n$$\n\nSince $x > 2$, we have $(k - 1)x > 2(k - 1)x)$. Therefore, we can choose $k$ such that $(k - 1)x > 2(k - 1)x) + \\frac{1}{k}}$.\n\nThis implies that $I(n, k) > x$.\n\nTherefore, for any integer $x>2$, there exists an ordered pair $(n, k)$ for which $I(n, k)>x$.
