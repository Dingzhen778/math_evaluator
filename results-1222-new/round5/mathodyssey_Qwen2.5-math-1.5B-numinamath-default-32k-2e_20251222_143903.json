From equation 1, we can express $s$ in terms of $c$ and $t$:\n   $s = 100 - c \\cdot t$\n\n2. From equation 2, we can express $c$ in terms of $s$ and $t$:\n   $c = 101 - s \\cdot t$\n\n3.

We use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find this inverse.\n\nApplying the Euclidean Algorithm:\n\\[ 2003 = 1 \\times 1988 + 15 \\]\n\\[ 1988 = 132 \\times 15 + 8 \\]\n\\[ 15 = 1 \\times 8 + 7 \\]\n\\[ 8 = 1 \\times 7 + 1 \\]\n\\[ 7 = 7 \\times 1 + 0 \\]\n\nNow, we backtrack to express 1 as a combination of 2003 and 1988:\n\\[ 1 = 8 - 1 \\times 7 \\]\n\\[ 1 = 8 - 1 \\times (15 - 1 \\times 8)) \\]\n\\[ 1 = 8 - 15 + 8 \\]\n\\[ 1 = 2 \\times 8 - 15 \\]\n\\[ 1 = 2 \\times (1988 - 132 \\times 15) - 15 \\]\n\\[ 1 = 2 \\times 1988 - 2 \\times 132 \\times 15 - 15 \\]\n\\[ 1 = 2 \\times 1988 - 2 \\times 132 \\times 15 - 15 \\]\n\nFinally, we find the smallest \\( k \\) such that \\( 1988k \\equiv 1994 \\pmod{2003} \\).\n\nAfter solving the congruence, we find that the smallest \\( k \\) is 1001.\n\nTherefore, the smallest natural number \\( N \\) is:\n\\[ N = 10000 \\times 1001 + 2022 \\]\n\\[ N = 10010000 + 2022 \\]\n\\[ N = 10010000 + 2022 \\]\n\\[ N = 10010000 + 2022 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{10010000 + 2022} \\]",

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Conditions\n\n1. **Condition (1):** \\( f \\circ f = I_X \\)\n   - This means that applying \\( f \\) twice returns the original element. In other words, \\( f \\) is an involution.\n\n2. **Condition (2):** \\( |f(i) - i| = 2 \\) for any \\( i \\in X \\)\n   - This condition implies that for any \\( i \\in X \\), the value \\( f(i) \\) is either 2 units greater or 2 units less than \\( i \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Implications of Condition (2)\n\nGiven \\( |f(i) - i| = 2 \\), we have two possible cases for each \\( i \\):\n- \\( f(i) = i + 2 \\)\n- \\( f(i) = i - 2 \\)\n\n### Step 3: Ensuring Condition (1) is Satisfied\n\nSince \\( f \\) is an involution, applying \\( f \\) twice must return the original element. This means that if \\( f(i) = i + 2 \\), then \\( f(i + 2) = i \\). Similarly, if \\( f(i) = i - 2 \\), then \\( f(i - 2) = i \\).\n\n### Step 4: Constructing the Mappings\n\nTo satisfy both conditions, we need to pair elements in \\( X \\) such that each pair \\((i, j)\\) satisfies \\( f(i) = j \\) and \\( f(j) = i \\). Additionally, each element must be paired with another element that is exactly 2 units away.\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Valid Pairings\n\nWe need to count the number of ways to pair the elements of \\( X \\) such that each pair is exactly 2 units apart. This is equivalent to finding the number of perfect matchings in a graph where each vertex represents an element of \\( X \\) and each edge represents a pair of elements that are exactly 2 units apart.\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Number of Perfect Matchings\n\nThe number of perfect matchings in a graph where each vertex represents an element of \\( X \\) and each edge represents a pair of elements that are exactly 2 units apart can be calculated using combinatorial methods. However, for this specific problem, we can use the fact that the number of such pairings is given by the number of ways to partition the set \\( X \\) into pairs of elements that are exactly 2 units apart.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter calculating the number of valid pairings, we find that the number of mappings \\( f \\) that satisfy both conditions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]",

To do this, we can use the fact that a polynomial of degree \\( n \\) can have at most \\( n \\) roots.\n\nSince \\( P(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree 2022, it can have at most 2022 roots. However, we are interested in the number of roots in the interval (0,1).\n\nTo find the maximum number of roots in the interval (0,1), we can use the fact that the polynomial \\( P(x) \\) can change sign at most 2022 times. Since we are interested in the number of roots in the interval (0,1), we can use the fact that the polynomial \\( P(x) \\) can change sign at most 2022 times.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of roots that \\( P(x) \\) can have in the interval (0,1) is \\(\\boxed{2022}\\).} \\)",

Since the digits can be between 0 and 9, the sum of the four digits can be any number between 0 and 36.\n\nTo find the probability that the sum of the four digits at a certain moment is smaller than S, we need to count the number of possible sums that are smaller than S and divide it by the total number of possible sums.\n\nLet's denote the number of possible sums that are smaller than S as N.

However, based on the constraints given, it is likely that the maximum number of guests that can be accommodated is less than the total number of combinations (9^4).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{The maximum number of guests that can be accommodated is less than } 9^4.}\\]",

The number has at least three different digits.\n2. The digits 1 and 6 are not adjacent.\n\nLet's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Total number of five-digit numbers:**\n   Each digit in the five-digit number can be any of the 6 digits (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Therefore, the total number of five-digit numbers is:\n   \\[\n   6^5 = 7776\n   \\]\n\n2. **Number of five-digit numbers with at most two different digits:**\n   - **Case 1: All digits are the same.**\n     There are 6 such numbers (11111, 22222, 33333, 44444, 55555, 66666).\n   - **Case 2: The number has exactly two different digits.**\n     We need to choose 2 digits out of the 6 available digits. The number of ways to choose 2 digits from 6 is given by the combination formula \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\binom{6}{2}} = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!}} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1}} = 15\n     \\]\n     For each pair of digits, we need to count the number of five-digit numbers that can be formed.

Therefore, we can factor out 3 from the quadratic function:\n\n$$f(x) = 12x^2 + 36x + 27 = 3(4x^2 + 12x + 9)$$\n\nNext, we need to factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses. We can do this by finding two numbers that multiply to the product of the leading coefficient and the constant term (in this case, $4 \\cdot 9 = 36$), and add up to the coefficient of the middle term (in this case, 12). The two numbers that satisfy these conditions are 6 and 6, since $6 \\cdot 6 = 36$ and $6 + 6 = 12$.\n\nTherefore, we can factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses as follows:\n\n$$4x^2 + 12x + 9 = (2x + 3)(2x + 3) = (2x + 3)^2$$\n\nSubstituting this factorization back into the expression for $f(x)$, we get:\n\n$$f(x) = 3(4x^2 + 12x + 9) = 3(2x + 3)^2$$\n\nTherefore, the equation that shows the function $f(x) = 12x^2 + 36x + 27$ in intercept form is:\n\n$$\\boxed{f(x) = 3(2x + 3)^2}}$$\n\nThis corresponds to option B.",

Therefore, we can factor the denominator as:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 3x - 18 = (x - 6)(x + 3)\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the Expression\nNow, substitute the factored forms of the numerator and the denominator into the original expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^2 - 9}{x^2 - 3x - 18}} = \\frac{(x - 3)(x + 3))}{(x - 6)(x + 3))}\n\\]\n\nWe can cancel the common factor \\((x + 3)\\) in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(x - 3)(x + 3))}{(x - 6)(x + 3)}} = \\frac{x - 3}{x - 6}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Domain Restrictions\nThe simplified expression \\(\\frac{x - 3}{x - 6}}\\) is undefined when the denominator is zero. Therefore, we set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx - 6 = 0 \\implies x = 6\n\\]\n\nAdditionally, we must consider the original factored form of the denominator \\((x - 6)(x + 3))\\). The expression is also undefined when \\(x + 3 = 0\\):\n\n\\[\nx + 3 = 0 \\implies x = -3\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe domain restrictions for the given expression are \\(x = 6\\) and \\(x = -3\\). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]",

The general solution to this equation can be found using the method of characteristics. The characteristic equations are:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dt}{1} = \\frac{dx}{2} = \\frac{du}{0}}\n   \\]\n   From $\\frac{dt}{1} = \\frac{dx}{2}$, we get:\n   \\[\n   2t = x + C_1 \\implies C_1 = 2t - x\n   \\]\n   From $\\frac{du}{0}$, we get:\n   \\[\n   du = 0 \\implies u = C_2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the general solution is:\n   \\[\n   u(t, x) = f(2t - x))\n   \\]\n   where $f$ is an arbitrary function.\n\n2. **Applying the Initial Condition:**\n\n   The initial condition is $u(0, x) = e^{-x}$ for $x > 0$.

This is only possible if $B = 0$ and $A = 1$.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n\n   The values of $A$ and $B$ such that there is a solution $u(t, x)$ is $C^1$ in $\\{t \\geq 0, x \\leq 0\\}$ to the equation are:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{A = 1, B = 0}\n   \\]",

Then, $du = dx$ and $v = -2e^{-x}$.\n\nApplying integration by parts:\n$$E(X) = \\\\left[ -2xe^{-x} \\\\right]_{1}^{\\infty} + \\\\int_{1}^{\\infty} 2e^{-x} dx.$$\n\nEvaluating the limits and the integral:\n$$E(X) = \\\\left[ -2xe^{-x} \\\\right]_{1}^{\\infty} + \\\\left[ -2e^{-x} \\\\right]_{1}^{\\infty}.$$\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$E(X) = \\\\left[ 0 - (-2e^{-1}}) \\\\right] + \\\\left[ 0 - (-2e^{-1}}) \\\\right].$$\n\n$$E(X) = 4e^{-1}.$$\n\nNow, we calculate the second moment of $X$, denoted as $E(X^2)$:\n$$E(X^2) = \\\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 f(x) dx = \\\\int_{1}^{\\infty} x^2 (2e^{-x}) dx.$$\n\nTo solve this integral, we can again use integration by parts.
