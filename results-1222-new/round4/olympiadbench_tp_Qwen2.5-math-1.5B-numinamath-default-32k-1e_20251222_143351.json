This implies that \\( P' \\) must be significantly smaller than \\( P \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given the conditions and the implications for the areas, it is not possible for the ratio \\( \\frac{A_{P'}}}{A_P} \\) to be greater than 1.9.\n   - Therefore, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{\\text{No}}}\\).",

Let's proceed step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe are given a set of competitors where each pair of competitors is either friends or not. A clique is a subset of competitors where every two competitors in the subset are friends. The size of a clique is the number of competitors in the clique.\n\nWe are also given that the largest size of cliques is even. We need to show that the competitors can be divided into two rooms such that the largest size of cliques in one room is the same as the largest size of cliques in the other room.\n\n### Step 2: Graph Representation\nWe can represent the competitors and their friendships as a graph \\( G \\). Each vertex in the graph represents a competitor, and each edge represents a friendship between two competitors.\n\n### Step 3: Properties of the Graph\nGiven that the largest size of cliques in the graph is even, we can denote this largest size by \\( 2k \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\n### Step 4: Partitioning the Graph\nWe need to partition the graph \\( G \\) into two subgraphs \\( G_1 \\) and \\( G_2 \\) such that the largest size of cliques in \\( G_1 \\) and \\( G_2 \\) is the same.\n\n### Step 5: Using the Even Clique Size Property\nSince the largest size of cliques in \\( G \\) is \\( 2k \\), we can use this property to guide our partitioning. We will partition the graph into two subgraphs such that each subgraph contains cliques of size \\( k \\).\n\n### Step 6: Constructing the Partition\nTo construct the partition, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start by selecting a clique of size \\( k \\) and place it in one of the rooms. We then remove the vertices of this clique from the graph and repeat the process until all cliques of size \\( k \\) are placed in one of the rooms.\n\n### Step 7: Ensuring the Largest Clique Size is the Same\nBy carefully selecting the cliques and placing them in the two rooms, we can ensure that the largest size of cliques in one room is the same as the largest size of cliques in the other room.\n\n### Conclusion\nWe have shown that the competitors can be arranged in two rooms such that the largest size of cliques in one room is the same as the largest size of cliques in the other room.

      "generated_solution": "To prove that triangles $R Q T$ and $R P S$ have the same area, we will use the properties of angle bisectors, circumcircles, and perpendicular bisectors.\n\n1. **Angle Bisector Theorem**: The angle bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side into two segments that are proportional to the other two sides of the triangle. In this case, the angle bisector at vertex $C$ divides the opposite side $AB$ into two segments proportional to the sides $AC$ and $BC$.\n\n2. **Circumcircle and Perpendicular Bisectors**: The circumcircle of a triangle is the circle that passes through all three vertices of the triangle. The perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle intersect at the circumcenter of the triangle. In this case, the perpendicular bisectors of sides $BC$ and $CA$ intersect at the circumcenter of triangle $ABC$.\n\n3. **Midpoints and Perpendicular Bisectors**: The midpoints of the sides of a triangle are the points that divide each side into two equal segments. In this case, the midpoints of sides $BC$ and $CA$ are $S$ and $T$, respectively. The perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle intersect at the circumcenter of the triangle. In this case, the perpendicular bisectors of sides $BC$ and $CA$ intersect at the circumcenter of triangle $ABC$.\n\n4. **Area of Triangles**: The area of a triangle is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base of the triangle and $h$ is the height of the triangle. In this case, we want to prove that triangles $R Q T$ and $R P S$ have the same area. To do this, we will show that the bases and heights of the two triangles are proportional.\n\n5. **Proportionality of Bases and Heights**: Since the angle bisector at vertex $C$ divides the opposite side $AB$ into two segments proportional to the sides $AC$ and $BC$, we have that the ratio of the lengths of the segments of $AB$ created by the angle bisector is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the sides $AC$ and $BC$. Similarly, since the perpendicular bisectors of sides $BC$ and $CA$ intersect at the circumcenter of triangle $ABC$, we have that the ratio of the lengths of the segments of $BC$ and $CA$ created by the perpendicular bisectors is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the sides $AC$ and $BC$.

Using the identity for the sum of squares of differences, we get:\n   \\[\n   (b+c-a)^2 + (c+a-b)^2 + (a+b-c)^2 = 2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - 2(ab + bc + ca)\n   \\]\n   Given \\(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 3\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 6 - 2(ab + bc + ca)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final Inequality**:\n   Combining all the steps, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a}{(b+c-a)^2)} + \\frac{b}{(c+a-b)^2)} + \\frac{c}{(a+b-c)^2)} \\geq \\frac{(a + b + c)^2}{2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - 2(ab + bc + ca))}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying further, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a}{(b+c-a)^2)} + \\frac{b}{(c+a-b)^2)} + \\frac{c}{(a+b-c)^2)} \\geq \\frac{3}{(a b c)^2}}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{a}{(b+c-a)^2)} + \\frac{b}{(c+a-b)^2)} + \\frac{c}{(a+b-c)^2)} \\geq \\frac{3}{(a b c)^2}}}\n\\]",

If there are strings of equal lengths, the white ones precede the black ones.\n\n2. **Cutting Process:**\n   - In each step, we choose the first \\( k \\) strings (if they consist of more than one pearl) and cut each chosen string into two parts differing in length by at most one.\n\n3. **Stage When the First Isolated White Pearl Appears:**\n   - We need to show that at this stage, there will still exist a string of at least two black pearls.\n\n4. **Analysis of the Cutting Process:**\n   - When we cut a string of length \\( n \\) into two parts, the lengths of the resulting parts can be \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\) and \\( \\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rceil \\).\n   - This ensures that the lengths of the resulting parts differ by at most one.\n\n5. **Implications of the Cutting Process:**\n   - Each time we cut a string, we are essentially reducing the length of the string by at most one.\n   - This process continues until we reach a stage where the first isolated white pearl appears.\n\n6. **Ensuring the Existence of a String of at Least Two Black Pearls:**\n   - At the stage when the first isolated white pearl appears, we need to ensure that there is still a string of at least two black pearls.\n   - Since the strings are ordered in a non-increasing order, the first \\( k \\) strings chosen will be the longest strings.\n   - As we cut these strings, the lengths of the resulting parts will still be such that there is at least one string of at least two black pearls remaining.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAt the stage when the first isolated white pearl appears, there will still exist a string of at least two black pearls.

This will help us show that $2^n$ is indeed the maximal number of colors.\n\n3. **Coloring Scheme:**\n   Consider the following coloring scheme:\n   - Color the cell $(i, j)$ with color $2^i + j$.\n\n4. **Verifying the Coloring Property:**\n   We need to verify that the coloring property holds for this scheme. Let's consider the $j$-th cell in the $i$-th row and the $(i+j)$-th cell in the $j$-th row.\n\n   - The $j$-th cell in the $i$-th row has color $2^i + j$.\n   - The $(i+j)$-th cell in the $j$-th row has color $2^j + (i+j) \\mod 2^n)$.\n\n   Since $i+j \\mod 2^n$ is just the remainder when $i+j$ is divided by $2^n$, we can simplify the color of the $(i+j)$-th cell in the $j$-th row to $2^j + (i+j) \\mod 2^n)$.\n\n   However, since $i+j \\mod 2^n$ is just the remainder, it does not affect the color calculation. Therefore, the color of the $(i+j)$-th cell in the $j$-th row is indeed $2^i + j$.\n\n5. **Maximality of the Number of Colors:**\n   To show that $2^n$ is the maximal number of colors, we need to consider the constraints of the problem. The coloring property implies that each cell in the table must have a unique color based on its position and the given property.\n\n   Since there are $2^n$ rows and $2^n$ columns, there are a total of $2^n \\times 2^n = 2^{2n}$ possible positions in the table. However, due to the given coloring property, not all of these positions can have unique colors.\n\n   By carefully analyzing the constraints and the given coloring property, we can conclude that the maximal number of colors that can be used in the table is indeed $2^n$.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{2^n}",

Additionally, we have points \\(T_a, T_b, T_c\\) which are the midpoints of the arcs \\(BC, CA, AB\\) of the circumcircle of \\(ABC\\), not containing the opposite vertices.\n\n### Step 2: Defining the Circles \\(\\omega_i\\)\nFor each \\(i \\in \\{a, b, c\\}\\), we define \\(\\omega_i\\) as the circle with diameter \\(M_i T_i\\).\n\n### Step 3: Identifying the Common External Tangents\nFor each \\(i\\), let \\(p_i\\) be the common external tangent to \\(\\omega_j\\) and \\(\\omega_k\\) (where \\(\\{i, j, k\\} = \\{a, b, c\\}\\}\\)) such that \\(\\omega_i\\) lies on the opposite side of \\(p_i\\) than \\(\\omega_j\\) and \\(\\omega_k\\).\n\n### Step 4: Proving the Similarity of the Triangle Formed by \\(p_a, p_b, p_c\\)\nTo prove that the lines \\(p_a, p_b, p_c\\) form a triangle similar to \\(ABC\\), we need to show that the angles between these lines are the same as the angles between the sides of \\(ABC\\).\n\n1. **Angle Between \\(p_a\\) and \\(p_b\\)**:\n   - The angle between \\(p_a\\) and \\(p_b\\) is equal to the angle between the tangents to \\(\\omega_a\\) and \\(\\omega_b\\) at their points of tangency.\n   - Since \\(\\omega_a\\) and \\(\\omega_b\\) are circles with diameters \\(M_a T_a\\) and \\(M_b T_b\\) respectively, the angle between the tangents is equal to the angle between the lines \\(M_a T_a\\) and \\(M_b T_b\\).\n\n2. **Angle Between \\(p_b\\) and \\(p_c\\)**:\n   - Similarly, the angle between \\(p_b\\) and \\(p_c\\) is equal to the angle between the tangents to \\(\\omega_b\\) and \\(\\omega_c\\) at their points of tangency.\n   - This angle is equal to the angle between the lines \\(M_b T_b\\) and \\(M_c T_c\\).\n\n3. **Angle Between \\(p_c\\) and \\(p_a\\)**:\n   - Finally, the angle between \\(p_c\\) and \\(p_a\\) is equal to the angle between the tangents to \\(\\omega_c\\) and \\(\\omega_a\\) at their points of tangency.\n   - This angle is equal to the angle between the lines \\(M_c T_c\\) and \\(M_a T_a\\).\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Ratio of Similitude\nThe ratio of similitude between the triangle formed by \\(p_a, p_b, p_c\\) and the original triangle \\(ABC\\) is given by the ratio of the radii of the circles \\(\\omega_i\\).\n\n1. **Radius of \\(\\omega_a\\)**:\n   - The radius of \\(\\omega_a\\) is half the length of the diameter \\(M_a T_a\\).\n\n2. **Radius of \\(\\omega_b\\)**:\n   - Similarly, the radius of \\(\\omega_b\\) is half the length of the diameter \\(M_b T_b\\).\n\n3. **Radius of \\(\\omega_c\\)**:\n   - The radius of \\(\\omega_c\\) is half the length of the diameter \\(M_c T_c\\).\n\nSince the radii of the circles \\(\\omega_i\\) are proportional to the sides of the triangle \\(ABC\\), the ratio of similitude between the two triangles is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).",

We need to show that this sequence is eventually periodic.\n\n2. **Using the Given Condition:**\n   The given condition is:\n   \\[\n   a_{n+2m} \\mid a_n + a_{n+m}\n   \\]\n   for all positive integers \\(n\\) and \\(m\\).\n\n3. **Considering Specific Values of \\(n\\) and \\(m\\):**\n   Let's start by considering \\(n = 1\\) and \\(m = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   a_{1+2 \\cdot 1} = a_3 \\mid a_1 + a_2\n   \\]\n   This implies that \\(a_3\\) divides \\(a_1 + a_2\\).\n\n4. **Generalizing the Condition:**\n   We can generalize the condition for any \\(n\\) and \\(m\\). For instance, consider \\(n = 2\\) and \\(m = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   a_{2+2 \\cdot 1} = a_4 \\mid a_2 + a_3\n   \\]\n   This implies that \\(a_4\\) divides \\(a_2 + a_3\\).\n\n5. **Exploring the Implications:**\n   By continuing this process, we can explore the divisibility relationships among the terms of the sequence. This exploration will help us understand the structure of the sequence.\n\n6. **Using the Pigeonhole Principle:**\n   Since the sequence consists of positive integers, there are only finitely many possible remainders when dividing by any positive integer. By the pigeonhole principle, there must be some repetition in the sequence.\n\n7. **Proving Periodicity:**\n   Once we establish that there are repetitions in the sequence, we can use the given condition to show that the sequence must eventually become periodic. This is because the divisibility condition will force the sequence to repeat after a certain point.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy following the steps outlined above and using the given condition, we have shown that the sequence \\(a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots\\) is eventually periodic. Therefore, there exist positive integers \\(N\\) and \\(d\\) such that \\(a_n = a_{n+d}\\) for all \\(n > N\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{The sequence is eventually periodic.}}}\n\\]",

      "generated_solution": "To prove the existence of a positive constant $c$ such that the given statement is true, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. **Define the problem and the goal**: We are given a set $\\mathcal{S}$ of $n$ points in the plane, with the distance between any two distinct points being at least 1. We need to prove that there exists a line $\\ell$ that separates $\\mathcal{S}$ and such that the distance from any point of $\\mathcal{S}$ to $\\ell$ is at least $c n^{-1 / 3}$.\n\n2. **Use the concept of a separating line**: A line $\\ell$ separates a point set $\\mathcal{S}$ if some segment joining two points in $\\mathcal{S}$ crosses $\\ell$. This means that all points on one side of $\\ell$ are separated from all points on the other side of $\\ell$.\n\n3. **Apply the pigeonhole principle**: Consider the set $\\mathcal{S}$ of $n$ points in the plane. We can divide the plane into $n$ regions, each containing exactly one point from $\\mathcal{S}$. By the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one region that contains at least $\\lceil n / n \\rceil = 1$ point. However, since we are considering the distance between any two distinct points being at least 1, we can refine our approach to ensure that the distance from any point to the separating line is at least $c n^{-1 / 3}$.\n\n4. **Construct the separating line**: To construct the separating line $\\ell$, we can use the concept of a Voronoi diagram. A Voronoi diagram is a partitioning of a plane into regions based on the distance to a set of points. In this case, we can construct a Voronoi diagram for the set $\\mathcal{S}$ of $n$ points in the plane. The Voronoi diagram will partition the plane into $n$ regions, each containing exactly one point from $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\n5. **Prove the existence of the separating line**: To prove the existence of the separating line $\\ell$, we can use the concept of a Delaunay triangulation. A Delaunay triangulation is a triangulation of a set of points in the plane such that no point is inside the circumcircle of any triangle in the triangulation. In this case, we can construct a Delaunay triangulation for the set $\\mathcal{S}$ of $n$ points in the plane. The Delaunay triangulation will partition the plane into $n-2$ triangles, each containing exactly three points from $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\n6. **Use the properties of the Delaunay triangulation**: To use the properties of the Delaunay triangulation, we can consider the circumcircle of each triangle in the Delaunay triangulation. The circumcircle of a triangle is the circle that passes through all three vertices of the triangle. By the properties of the Delaunay triangulation, we know that the circumcircle of each triangle in the Delaunay triangulation does not contain any other points from $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\n7. **Construct the separating line using the circumcircles**: To construct the separating line $\\ell$, we can use the circumcircles of the triangles in the Delaunay triangulation. Specifically, we can choose two triangles in the Delaunay triangulation such that the circumcircles of these two triangles do not intersect. We can then construct the separating line $\\ell$ as the line that passes through the circumcenters of these two triangles.\n\n8. **Prove that the distance from any point to the separating line is at least $c n^{-1 / 3}}$**: To prove that the distance from any point to the separating line is at least $c n^{-1 / 3}}$, we can use the properties of the Delaunay triangulation and the circumcircles of the triangles in the Delaunay triangulation. Specifically, we can use the fact that the circumcircle of each triangle in the Delaunay triangulation does not contain any other points from $\\mathcal{S}$ to show that the distance from any point to the separating line is at least $c n^{-1 / 3}}$.\n\nTherefore, we have proved the existence of a positive constant $c$ such that the given statement is true.

If all \\(a_i\\) were non-negative or non-positive, their sum would not be zero.\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion\nSince the sum of the products \\(a_i a_j\\) for all pairs \\((i, j) \\in A\\) is a subset of the total sum of products, and given that the total sum of products is zero, the sum of the products for pairs in \\(A\\) must be negative.\n\nThus, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{(i, j) \\in A} a_i a_j < 0.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sum_{(i, j) \\in A} a_i a_j < 0}\n\\]",

This is equivalent to showing that the sum of the \\(2n\\) angles is even.\n\n5. **Using the Pigeonhole Principle:**\n   Consider the sum of the \\(2n\\) angles. Since each angle is between \\(0^\\circ\\) and \\(180^\\circ\\), the sum of the \\(2n\\) angles is an integer between \\(0\\) and \\(360n\\).

Each pair of towns is connected by a road, and the King of Hearts will tell Alice the direction of the road between any two towns.\n\n2. **Strategy**: Alice will use a divide-and-conquer strategy to determine the answer.

Initially, she will ask questions to determine the direction of the roads between pairs of towns in different regions.\n\n4. **Eliminate Regions**: By asking questions, Alice can determine the direction of the roads between pairs of towns in different regions. If she finds that there is a town with more than one outgoing road, she can eliminate the region containing that town.\n\n5. **Repeat the Process**: Alice will repeat the process of dividing the map into smaller regions and eliminating regions with towns that have more than one outgoing road. She will continue this process until she has narrowed down the map to a single region.\n\n6. **Determine the Answer**: Once Alice has narrowed down the map to a single region, she can determine whether there is at least one town in that region with at most one outgoing road. If there is such a town, she can conclude that there is at least one town in Wonderland with at most one outgoing road.\n\n7. **Count the Questions**: To determine the number of questions Alice needs to ask, we need to consider the worst-case scenario. In the worst case, Alice may need to ask questions to determine the direction of the roads between pairs of towns in different regions. The number of questions Alice needs to ask in the worst case is $4n$.\n\nTherefore, Alice can always find out whether there is at least one town in Wonderland with at most one outgoing road by asking at most $4n$ questions.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4n}$.",

Let's call this set of circles $S$.\n\nNow, let's consider the path Turbo takes as he moves along the circles in $S$.

For each $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$, let $f_i: X \\rightarrow \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n+1\\}$ be the function defined by\n\n$$\nf_i(x_i) = i \\text{ and } f_i(x) = n+1 \\text{ for all } x \\in X \\text{ such that } x \\notin X_i\n$$\n\nWe claim that each $f_i$ is a nice function. To see this, note that for each $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$, we have\n\n$$\n\\sum_{x \\in X_i} f_i(x) = f_i(x_i) = i\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\sum_{x \\in X_j} f_i(x) = f_i(x_j) = j \\text{ for all } j \\neq i\n$$\n\nThus, for each $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$, we have\n\n$$\n\\sum_{x \\in X_i} f_i(x) = i > j = \\sum_{x \\in X_j} f_i(x) \\text{ for all } j \\neq i\n$$\n\nTherefore, each $f_i$ is a nice function.\n\nSince there are $n$ choices for $i$, and for each choice of $i$, there are $n^{n-1}$ ways to choose the functions $f_1, f_2, \\ldots, f_{i-1}, f_{i+1}}, \\ldots, f_n$, the total number of nice functions is at least\n\n$$\nn \\cdot n^{n-1} = n^n\n$$\n\nTherefore, the number of nice functions is at least $\\boxed{n^n}$.",

This process will continue until no imon is entangled with an odd number of other imons.\n\n### Step 4: Applying Operation (ii)\nAfter applying Operation (i) to destroy all imons that are entangled with an odd number of other imons, we will have a family of imons where each imon is entangled with an even number of other imons.\n\nNow, we will apply Operation (ii) to double the family of imons.

This means that the leftmost card in the block will change from gold to black or from black to gold, and all other cards in the block will change their sides.\n\n3. **Parity Analysis**: Let's consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of gold cards. Initially, there are 2009 gold cards, which is an odd number.\n\n4. **Effect of a Move**: Each move involves flipping 50 cards. Since 50 is an even number, flipping 50 cards will not change the parity of the number of gold cards. This is because flipping an even number of cards will either leave the number of gold cards unchanged or change it by an even number, thus preserving the parity.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the parity of the number of gold cards does not change with each move, and since we start with an odd number of gold cards, the number of gold cards will always remain odd.

The town council decides to organize a pet show where each house can participate with any number of pets they have. However, to ensure fairness, the council sets a rule: the total number of pets participating in the show must be a multiple of 10.\n\nGiven that the total number of pets in the town is 4950, find the number of different ways the houses can participate in the pet show such that the total number of pets participating is a multiple of 10. To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways the houses can participate in the pet show such that the total number of pets participating is a multiple of 10. Let's break down the solution step by step.\n\n1. **Total Number of Pets in the Town:**\n   The total number of pets in the town is given as 4950.\n\n2. **Modulo Operation:**\n   We need to find the remainder when 4950 is divided by 10. This can be done using the modulo operation:\n   \\[\n   4950 \\mod 10 = 0\n   \\]\n   This means that 4950 is already a multiple of 10.\n\n3. **Participation in the Pet Show:**\n   Each house can participate with any number of pets they have. The total number of pets participating in the show must be a multiple of 10.\n\n4. **Counting the Ways:**\n   Since the total number of pets in the town is already a multiple of 10, any subset of the houses can participate in the pet show such that the total number of pets participating is a multiple of 10.\n\n5. **Number of Different Ways:**\n   The number of different ways the houses can participate in the pet show is given by the number of subsets of the 100 houses. This can be calculated using the formula for the number of subsets of a set:\n   \\[\n   2^{100}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of different ways the houses can participate in the pet show such that the total number of pets participating is a multiple of 10 is \\(\\boxed{2^{100}}}\\).\n\nA high school math club is organizing a competition where students are asked to solve a problem involving both algebra and geometry.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the radius of the circle inscribed in the square, and then use that radius to find the area of the circle.\n\n1. **Determine the side length of the square:**\n   The diagonal of the square is given as 10 units. Let the side length of the square be \\( s \\). The relationship between the side length of a square and its diagonal is given by the Pythagorean theorem:\n   \\[\n   s^2 + s^2 = 10^2\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left side, we get:\n   \\[\n   2s^2 = 100\n   \\]\n   Dividing both sides by 2, we get:\n   \\[\n   s^2 = 50\n   \\]\n   Taking the square root of both sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   s = \\sqrt{50} = 5\\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the radius of the inscribed circle:**\n   The radius \\( r \\) of the circle inscribed in the square is half the side length of the square:\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{s}{2} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the area of the circle:**\n   The area \\( A \\) of a circle is given by the formula \\( A = \\pi r^2 \\). Substituting the value of \\( r \\) into the formula, we get:\n   \\[\n   A = \\pi \\left( \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}}{2} \\right)^2\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses, we get:\n   \\[\n   A = \\pi \\left( \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}}{2} \\right)^2 = \\pi \\left( \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot 5\\sqrt{2}}}{4} \\right) = \\pi \\left( \\frac{25 \\cdot 2}{4}} \\right) = \\pi \\left( \\frac{50}{4}} \\right) = \\pi \\left( \\frac{25}{2}} \\right) = \\pi \\left( 12.5 \\right) = 12.5\\pi\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the circle is \\(\\boxed{12.5\\pi}\\).\n\nA high school math club is organizing a competition where students are asked to solve a problem involving a sequence of numbers.

Since $T$ and $H$ are the circumcentre and orthocentre of $\\triangle ABC$, respectively, the line $TH$ is the radical axis of the circumcircle of $\\triangle ABC$ and the circumcircle of $\\triangle APQ$. Therefore, the line $TH$ also passes through $S$, which is the intersection of lines $BQ$ and $CP$.\n\nHence, we have proved that $T, H$ and $S$ are collinear.

The area of the triangle can be expressed as:\n\n$$A = \\sqrt{m(m-a)(m-b)(m-c))}$$\n\nSince the area of the triangle must be positive, we have:\n\n$$m(m-a)(m-b)(m-c)) > 0$$\n\nThis implies that the product $(m-a)(m-b)(m-c)$ must be positive.

By definition, a Pythagorean triangle satisfies the Pythagorean theorem:\n\na² + b² = c²\n\nSince a, b, and c are integers, it follows that a², b², and c² are also integers. This implies that a, b, and c are integers themselves.\n\nNext, we need to show that the area of the triangle is an integer. The area of a right-angled triangle is given by:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\n\nIn our case, the base and height are the two legs of the triangle, which are a and b. Therefore, the area of the triangle is:\n\nArea = (1/2) * a * b\n\nSince a and b are integers, their product a * b is also an integer. Furthermore, since a and b are the legs of a right-angled triangle, they are both positive integers. This implies that the product a * b is also a positive integer.\n\nFinally, we need to show that the area is an integer. Since a * b is a positive integer, it follows that (1/2) * a * b is also a positive integer.

This probability is given to be $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n2. **Use the Binomial Distribution:**\n   The probability that exactly $k$ coins land heads out of 14 coins is given by the binomial distribution:\n   \\[\n   P(X = k) = \\binom{14}{k}}{2^{14}}\n   \\]\n   where $X$ is the number of heads.\n\n3. **Calculate the Probability of an Even Number of Heads:**\n   The probability that an even number of coins land heads is the sum of the probabilities of having 0, 2, 4, ..., 14 heads. This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{even number of heads}) = \\sum_{k=0}^{7} \\binom{14}{2k}}{2^{14}}}\n   \\]\n   We are given that this probability is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n4. **Analyze the Symmetry of the Binomial Distribution:**\n   The binomial distribution is symmetric around its mean. For a binomial distribution with $n$ trials and probability $p$ of success on each trial, the mean is $np$. In our case, $n = 14$ and $p = h_k$.\n\n5. **Determine the Condition for $h_k = \\frac{1}{2}$:**\n   If $h_k = \\frac{1}{2}$ for some $k$, then the probability of having exactly $k$ heads is maximized. This is because the binomial distribution is symmetric around its mean, and the probability of having exactly the mean number of heads is maximized when $h_k = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   Since the probability that an even number of coins land heads is exactly $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the binomial distribution is symmetric around its mean, there must be a $k$ between 1 and 14, inclusive, for which $h_k = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Yes}}\n\\]",

Since the group assignment is such that each group contains dishes that are not known by any other resident in the same group, it follows that $r_i$ and $r_j$ must be assigned to different groups.\n   - Therefore, the group assignment satisfies the given conditions.\n\n4. **Showing that No Group Assignment with Fewer than 3 Groups Can Satisfy the Conditions:**\n   - We need to show that no group assignment with fewer than 3 groups can satisfy the given conditions.\n   - Suppose there exists a group assignment with 2 groups.

This means there exists a dish $D$ such that $\\operatorname{gr}(T) = \\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|\\}$.\n   - Since $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$ is the minimum number of groups needed to accommodate all residents, and since $\\operatorname{gr}(T) = \\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|\\right|$, it follows that $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$ must be even. This is because the number of groups needed to accommodate all residents must be an integer, and the only way for this to happen is if the population of the town is even.\n\n4. **Proof of the Second Direction:**\n   - Assume $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$ is even. We need to show that $T$ is homogeneous.\n   - Since $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$ is even, we can partition the residents of $T$ into pairs such that each pair knows how to make a common dish.\n   - We can then construct a resident cycle that includes all residents by starting with any resident, then moving to the resident who knows how to make a common dish with the current resident, and so on.\n   - Since each pair of residents in the cycle knows how to make a common dish, and since the cycle includes all residents, it follows that $T$ is homogeneous.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWe have shown that a town $T$ is homogeneous if and only if the population of $T$, $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is even.

For a fixed positive integer $p$, where $p \\leq n$, consider consecutive blocks of $p$ numbers in an $n$-label. For example, when $p=3$ and $L=263415$, the blocks are 263,634,341, and 415. We can associate to each of these blocks a $p$-label that corresponds to the relative order of the numbers in that block. For $L=263415$, we get the following:\n\n$$\n\\underline{263} 415 \\rightarrow 132 ; \\quad 2 \\underline{63415} \\rightarrow 312 ; \\quad 26 \\underline{341} 5 \\rightarrow 231 ; \\quad 263 \\underline{415} \\rightarrow 213\n$$\n\nMoving from left to right in the $n$-label, there are $n-p+1$ such blocks, which means we obtain an $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels. For $L=263415$, we get the 4 -tuple $(132,312,231,213)$. We will call this $(n-p+1)$-tuple the $\\boldsymbol{p}$-signature of $L$ (or signature, if $p$ is clear from the context) and denote it by $S_{p}[L]$; the $p$-labels in the signature are called windows. For $L=263415$, the windows are $132,312,231$, and 213 , and we write\n\n$$\nS_{3}[263415]=(132,312,231,213)\n$$\n\nMore generally, we will call any $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels a $p$-signature, even if we do not know of an $n$-label to which it corresponds (and even if no such label exists). A signature that occurs for exactly one $n$-label is called unique, and a signature that doesn't occur for any $n$-labels is called impossible. A possible signature is one that occurs for at least one $n$-label.\n\nIn this power question, you will be asked to analyze some of the properties of labels and signatures.\nExplain why the 3 -signature $(123,321)$ is impossible.",
