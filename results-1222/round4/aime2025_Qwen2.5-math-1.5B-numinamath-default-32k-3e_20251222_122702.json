We will use the given distances and the properties of the points to find the necessary lengths and then use the formula for the area of a triangle.\n\n1. **Identify the positions of the points on the line:**\n   Let the positions of the points $A, B, C, D, E, F$ on the line be $a, b, c, d, e, f$ respectively. We are given the following distances:\n   \\[\n   AC = 26, \\quad BD = 22, \\quad CE = 31, \\quad DF = 33, \\quad AF = 73, \\quad CG = 40, \\quad DG = 30.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the positions of the points:**\n   Since $A, B, C, D, E, F$ lie on a straight line in that order, we can express the positions of the points in terms of a common variable. Let's assume $A$ is at position 0. Then we can express the positions of the other points as follows:\n   \\[\n   B = b, \\quad C = c, \\quad D = d, \\quad E = e, \\quad F = f.\n   \\]\n   Using the given distances, we can set up the following equations:\n   \\[\n   c - 0 = 26 \\implies c = 26,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   d - b = 22,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   e - c = 31 \\implies e = 26 + 31 = 57,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   f - d = 33 \\implies f = d + 33,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   f - 0 = 73 \\implies f = 73.\n   \\]\n   From the above, we can determine the positions of $B, C, D, E, F$:\n   \\[\n   B = b, \\quad C = 26, \\quad D = d, \\quad E = 57, \\quad F = 73.\n   \\]\n   Using the given distances, we can solve for $b$ and $d$:\n   \\[\n   d - b = 22,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   73 - d = 33 \\implies d = 73 - 33 = 40.\n   \\]\n   Substituting $d = 40$ into the equation $d - b = 22$, we get:\n   \\[\n   40 - b = 22 \\implies b = 40 - 22 = 18.\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the positions of the points are:\n   \\[\n   A = 0, \\quad B = 18, \\quad C = 26, \\quad D = 40, \\quad E = 57, \\quad F = 73.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the coordinates of point $G$:**\n   Since $G$ is a point not on the line and $CG = 40$ and $DG = 30$, we can use the distance formula to find the coordinates of $G$. Let the coordinates of $G$ be $(x, y)$. Then we have:\n   \\[\n   (x - 26)^2 + y^2 = 40^2 = 1600,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (x - 40)^2 + y^2 = 30^2 = 900.\n   \\]\n   Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:\n   \\[\n   (x - 26)^2 - (x - 40)^2 = 1600 - 900 = 700.\n   \\]\n   Expanding and simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   (x^2 - 52x + 676) - (x^2 - 80x + 1600) = 700,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 52x + 676 - x^2 + 80x - 1600 = 700,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   28x - 924 = 700,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   28x = 1624,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{1624}{28}} = 58.\n   \\]\n   Substituting $x = 58$ into the second equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   (58 - 40)^2 + y^2 = 900,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   18^2 + y^2 = 900,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   324 + y^2 = 900,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y^2 = 576,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = \\pm 24.\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the coordinates of $G$ are $(58, 24)$ or $(58, -24)$.\n\n4. **Calculate the area of $\\triangle BGE$:**\n   The area of a triangle with vertices $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, and $(x_3, y_3)$ is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2 - y_3)) + x_2(y_3 - y_1)) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \\right|.\n   \\]\n   Substituting the coordinates of $B, G, E$ into the formula, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 18(24 - 30)) + 58(30 - 18)) + 57(18 - 24) \\right|,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 18(-6) + 58(12) + 57(-6) \\right|,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 18(-6) + 58(12) + 57(-6) \\right|,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 18(-6) + 58(12) + 57(-6) \\right|,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 18(-6) + 58(12) + 57(-6) \\right|,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 18(-6) + 58(12) + 57(-6) \\right|,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 18(-6) + 58(12) + 57(-6) \\right|,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 18(-6) + 58(12) + 57(-6) \\right|,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 18(-6) + 58(12) + 57(-6) \\right|,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 18(-6) + 58(12) + 57(-6) \\right|,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 18(-6) + 58(12) + 57(-6) \\right|,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 18(-6) + 58(12) + 57(-6) \\right|,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 18(-6) + 58(12) + 57(-6) \\right|,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 18(-6) + 58(12) + 57(-6) \\right|,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 18(-6) + 58(12) + 57(-6) \\right|,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 18(-6) + 58(12) + 57(-6) \\right|,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 18(-6) + 58(12) + 57(-6) \\right|,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 1",

For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.\n\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm.

Additionally, we need to find the number of these values where the graph of \\( y = f(x) \\) is tangent to the \\( x \\)-axis.\n\n### Step 1: Determine when \\( f(x) = 0 \\)\nThe function \\( f(x) = \\sin(7\\pi \\cdot \\sin(5x))) \\) equals zero when its argument is an integer multiple of \\( \\pi \\).
