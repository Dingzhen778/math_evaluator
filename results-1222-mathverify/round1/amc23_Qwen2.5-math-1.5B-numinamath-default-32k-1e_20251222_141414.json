      "generated_solution": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the largest value \\( x \\) in cents that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of the coin values 6, 10, and 15 cents. This problem is a classic example of the Frobenius coin problem, which deals with finding the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of two given coprime integers.\n\nHowever, in this case, we have three coin values, which makes the problem more complex. We will use the Chicken McNugget theorem (also known as the Frobenius coin problem for two coprime integers) as a starting point and extend it to three coin values.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Coin Values:**\n   The coin values are 6, 10, and 15 cents.\n\n2. **Check for Coprimality:**\n   We need to check if the coin values are pairwise coprime.
